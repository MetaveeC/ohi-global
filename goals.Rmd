OHI assessments categorize and score goals representing ocean-derived benefits to people.

**Global assessments score 10 goals, some of which have sub-goals**.  
Here you will find information about how goals were represented, including how they are affected by pressures and resilience measures. You can also learn how data were processed.

**TO CONSIDER** (and see [SEASIDE CHAT NOTES](https://github.com/OHI-Science/issues/issues/665#issuecomment-261118749))

- remove layers page and instead list layers and links to data prep below the goals
- show Mel's pie chart
- [little icon figures!]
- Tiny figures showing relative contributions?
