Global scores ranged from `r min(scores_0$score)` (in the `r scores_0$goal[scores_0$score == min(scores_0$score)]` goal) to `r max(scores_0$score)`  (in the `r scores_0$goal[scores_0$score == max(scores_0$score)]` goal). Other fascinating results include that scores differed in different regions. For example...
