*Pressure*

*Category: ecological*

*Subcategory: fishing pressure*

This pressure layer uses fish catch reconstruction data from the [Sea Around Us Project](http://www.seaaroundus.org/) (SAUP) to model artisanal fishing at a resolution of 0.5 degrees globally. Artisanal catch (tons) per 0.5 degree cell is aggregated across three of the four reporting sectors from SAUP; artisanal, subsistence and recreational catch. Aggregated catch is then standardized by mean net primary productivity (mg C/m^2/day) derived from monthly output from the Vertically Generalized Production Model (VGPM) available here: http://www.science.oregonstate.edu/ocean.productivity/. Standardizing catch by primary productivity accounts for the same fishing pressure having different impacts depending on the productivity in the region. The layer is rescaled from 0 to 1 using the 99.99th quantile of the entire data layer.
