#### Mangroves 
Mangrove data are used to calculate the coastal proection and carbon storage goals, and the habitat subgoal.

Hamilton and Casey's (2016) yearly (2000-2012) mangrove cover data were used to calculate mangrove extent (km^2^).  Data were provided at 30m raster cell resolution (with the estimated area of mangrove cover in each cell) which we converted to 500m resolution to facilitate global calculations.
