Soft bottom subtidal habitat condition was estimated using intensity of trawl fishing relative to soft bottom subtidal habitat area. Global catch data (Watson 2017) is provided at 0.5 degree raster scale in units of tonnes/km2 for each species and fishing gear type.  We identify catch from trawling gear, defined as dredges, hand dredges, bottom trawls, and shrimp trawls (mid-water trawls were excluded). We sum the trawled catch data for each OHI region for each year, and convert to catch density by dividing the annual catch by the area of trawlable (soft-bottom) habitat. ‘Trawlable habitat’ within a region was defined as shallow subtidal (0-60m) and outer shelf (60-200m) soft bottom habitat. Because the density data were extremely skewed, we $ln(X+1)$ transformed them and then rescaled to the 95th quantile value from all year-country possibilities. Condition was then calculated as one minus the rescaled catch density in the most recent year and further rescaled to the median condition value across all years, and any value greater than the median was set = 1.0.
