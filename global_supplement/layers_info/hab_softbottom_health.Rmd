Soft bottom subtidal habitat condition was estimated using intensity of fishing with different gear types relative to how much they affect the soft bottom subtidal habitat area. Global catch data (Watson 2018) is provided at 0.5 degree raster scale in units of tonnes for each species and fishing gear type.  For each gear type we assing a multiplier acording to how much the gear affects the sea soft bottom (trwal and dredge = 1, gillnet and trap = 0.5, "other" = 0.25 and trawl midwats, pole and lin, longline, purse seine and saine = 0).
We sum the catch data for comercioanl and non-comercial captures for each OHI region, each year, and convert to catch density by dividing the annual catch by the area soft-bottom habitat. The extent of soft-bottom area within a region was defined as shallow subtidal (0-60m) and outer shelf (60-200m) soft bottom habitat. Because the density data were extremely skewed, we $ln(X+1)$ transformed them and then rescaled dividing by max value across all years/regions.Condition was then calculated as one minus the rescaled catch density in the most recent year and further rescaled to the median condition value across all years, and any value greater than the median was set = 1.0.
