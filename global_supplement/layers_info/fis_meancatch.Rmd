Mean annual catch per taxon for each region is calculated using spatially explicit catch reconstruction data from the [Sea Around Us Project](http://www.seaaroundus.org/). Taxnomic levels range from species to class to "Miscellaneous not identified". Catch per taxon values from the catch-data were summed within each FAO major fishing area (www.fao.org/fishery/area/search/en) to produce a single time-series from 1980 to present for each taxon within a given fishing area. These data are used to run the catch-MSY model (Martell & Froese 2012) estimating B/BMSY (see B/Bmsy estimates layer). This time frame provides sufficient data for the catch-MSY model to calculate stock status, although it could mask some fisheries dynamics as fishing-driven stock depletion had already occurred by 1980 for many stocks.
