#### Seagrass 
Trend in seagrass condition was determined using two data sources (Waycott et al. 2009, Short et al. 2010). Short et al. (2010) measured percent cover on a per sample, per site, per year basis, whereas Waycott et al. (2009) measured habitat area on a per site, per year basis. We used data from Short if there were at least 3 data points between 2001-2010. If this condition was not met, we calculated trends from Waycott for the most recent 10 years after 1990 or else we used the mean of the trend in the adjacent regions or the regions within the corresponding seagrass geographical regions using the same methods described above for the in status.
