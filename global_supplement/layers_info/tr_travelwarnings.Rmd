Travel advisories are from the U.S. State Department ([https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings.html](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings.html)) or or Canada's Government Travel Advise and Advisory ([https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories).  Penalty scores were based on the urgency of warning (‘Exercise Normal Precautions’= 1, ‘Exercise Increase Caution’= 0.75, ‘Reconsider Travel’=0.25, and ‘Do Not Travel’ = 0).
