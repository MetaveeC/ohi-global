Mariculture capacity/potential was determined for each region using Mapping the global potential for marine aquaculture ([Gentry et al. 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0257-9)). Global data were provided at 0.0083 degree resolution. The total mariculture capacity count data was calculated for each region by extracting the relevant cell data using the OHI regions shapefile.
