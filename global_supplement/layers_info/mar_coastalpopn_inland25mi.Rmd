Coastal population was determined for each region using Gridded Population of the World (GPW) Population Count Grid Future Estimates from the Center for International Earth Science Information Net (CIESIN)/Columbia University (CIESIN & CIAT 2005).  Global data were provided at 30 arc second resolution for five year intervals: eg., 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020. Intervening years were temporally interpolated, as: d2013 = 0.4 * d2010 + 0.6 * d2015. The total coastal population count data was calculated for each region by extracting the relevant cell data using a 25-mile inland coastal zone shapefile.
