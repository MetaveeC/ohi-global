The following data layers are used in Ocean Health Index calculations for goal status, trend, pressures, and resilience. Values for `r study_area` were extracted from the global assessment and saved for each region to serve as a template as you gather higher-resolution data and indicators. Note that many values do not have a range because they were equally extracted from the global data layer.
