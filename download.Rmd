Global assessments require synthesizing highly heterogeneous information that is freely available from nearly one hundred sources. Data from each source are prepared and modeled using freely available coding and version control software. You may freely download and use any data, code, or instructional guides, but please see our [Citation Policy](http://ohi-science.org/citation-policy/).

## Some header here

With each annual global assessment we have incrementally improved data processing and modeling methods based on new information, knowledge, and feedback. Thus, for annual scores to be comparable with previous years, we recalculate assessments from previous years with the most recent methods for each past assessment year. 


<div class="col2">
**Global assessment scores**

Quick access to *.csv* files of calculated global scores. View [metadata for these files]() -> an md with header info

- [2012]()
- [2013]()
- [2014]()
- [2015]()
- [2016]()

TODO! Do we want to use [radical_with_region_names](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/blob/draft/global2016/radical_with_region_names_2016-11-17.csv), modify scores.csv in this Rmd, or provide a lookup??

**Full methods and data**

All code and most data are available online on GitHub. We do annual 'releases', which include the newest methods for current and previous years.
