Global Ocean Health Index assessments require synthesizing highly heterogeneous information that is freely available from nearly one hundred sources. Before being incorporated into OHI models, data from each source must be organized, transformed, rescaled, formatted, and potentially gap-filled. This workflow, including all metadata and processing decisions, is fully documented and available here.  

Reproducibility and transparency have always been fundamental to OHI assessments and we now code and use version control collaboratively and openly. Here we provide our code, data, and workflows, as well as calculated scores for global assessments.

## Global assessment scores

Quick access to *.csv* files of calculated global scores.  

- [2012]()
- [2013]()
- [2014]()
- [2015]()
- [2016]()

TODO! Do we want to use [radical_with_region_names](https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/blob/draft/global2016/radical_with_region_names_2016-11-17.csv) or modify scores.csvs directly? We could do that right in this Rmd...
- goal: TODO explain 2/3 letter codes or write it out, and Index
- dimension: identifies status, trend, pressures, resilience, likely future state, or final score
- region_id: TODO 
- score: calculated score between 0-100.

## Full data and code

TODO

Data and scripts from OHI global assessments are available for 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. Explore the <a href="https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global/releases" target="_blank">data and methods used for these assessments (including Antarctica and the High Seas)</a>, stored on GitHub. 

## Thanks

TODO

We thank all the groups that collect and share data openly, as well as the developers that make free software tools available.
