#### OHI scores and average change in scores 2012-2016

<font size = 2>
The map below shows scores (or annual change in score) for the selected goal for the 220 coastal countries and regions included in the OHI, and the histogram shows the distribution of scores across the regions.

To view scores for the overall Index, choose a “score by year” and select “Index” under Ocean Health Goal. These figures correspond to Figure 1 A/B in the paper.  Score 2012 - 2016: Scores for the overall Index and each of the OHI goals and subgoals displayed for each region, for 2012 to 2016. To view scores for each OHI goal, choose a year and a goal from the dropdown menus. These figures correspond to Figures B and C in the paper.

Annual change 2016: Map of the slope estimates from a linear regression model of the Index scores from 2012 to 2016 for each region, for the overall Index as well as for each of the OHI goals and subgoals.  The Index figure corresponds to Figure 1C/D in the published paper, while the per-goal figures correspond to Figures D, E, and F in the supporting information.
