<h2>Food Provision: Fisheries</h2>
<div id="goal-description" class="section level3">
<h3>Goal Description</h3>
<p>The Fisheries sub-goal describes the amount of wild-caught seafood harvested and its sustainability for human consumption. The model generally compares landings with Maximum Sustainable Yield. A score of 100 means the country or region is harvesting seafood to the ecosystem’s production potential in an sustainable manner.</p>
</div>
<div id="model" class="section level3">
<h3>Model</h3>
<p>The model assess the amount of wild-caught seafood that can be sustainably harvested, with sustainability based on multi-species yield, and with penalties assigned for both over- and under-harvesting. Each taxa landed within each FAO major fishing area is assessed separately based on B/BMSY (maxium sustainable yield) and weighted by its relative contribution to overall catch. The goal status score for each reporting region in each year was calculated as the geometric mean of the all stock status scores (Halpern 2015).</p>
<p>To assess B/BMSY, In 2016 we developed an approach to measuring food provision from wild caught fisheries based on estimating population biomass relative to the biomass that can deliver maximum sustainable yield (B/BMSY) for each landed stock. The estimates of B/BMSY were obtained by applying a model developed by Martell &amp; Froese (2012), and hereafter referred to as the “catch-MSY” method. The latter was chosen, among other data-limited methods available, based on simulation-testing showing that it most accurately predicted stock status for simulated stocks having a broad range of life history traits and different known sources of uncertainty. The catch-MSY approach improves upon the method used in the 2012 OHI-Global assessment in that it: 1) leverages a mechanistic understanding of the connection between harvest dynamics and population dynamics and uses this to infer stock depletion levels (see also Thorson et al., 2013), 2) is an indicator of stock abundance (B) rather than catch, making it more directly informative of stock status, and 3) at least in some cases (i.e., those cases where the catch trajectory is not a monotonic increase), can be applied to developing fisheries (whereas the previous approach assumed a perfect score in those cases). (<em>NOTE: move this description to Ref point?</em>)</p>
<p><em>NOTE: mention model limitations here since FIS is such a difficult model and has many caveats?</em> The model is based on single-species assessments of stock status and thus cannot predict the effect of multi-species interactions.</p>

<h2>Food Provision: Mariculture</h2>
<div id="goal-description-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Goal Description</h3>
<p>Mariculture measures the ability to reach the highest levels of seafood gained from farm-raised facilities without damaging the ocean’s ability to provide fish sustainably now and in the future. Higher scores reflect high food provisioning in a sustainable manner, while not compromising the water quality in the farmed area and not relying on wild populations to feed or replenish the cultivated species. A score of 100 means that a region is sustainably harvesting the greatest amount of farmed seafood possible based on its own potential.</p>
</div>
<div id="model-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Model &amp; Data</h3>
<p>Model measures the quantity of sustainably harvested mariculture species per coastal inhabitant (i.e., those within 25km of the coast), under the assumption that mariculture development scales proportionally with coastal population, which is a proxy for potential logistic limitations to farm development, e.g., presence of infrastructures, coastal access, and locally available workforce. The <em>species assessed</em> are strictly marine species from both the marine and brackish water FAO categories, excluding aquatic plants such as kelps and seaweeds, which were assumed to contribute predominantly to medicinal and cosmetic uses rather than as a source of food (Halpern 2012). The <em>sustainability score (SM,k)</em> for each species in each country is based on the Mariculture Sustainability Index (MSI) (Halpern 2015).</p>

<h2>Artisanal Fishing Opportunity</h2>
<div id="goal-description-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Goal Description</h3>
<p>Artisanal fishing, often also called small-scale fishing, provides a critical source of food, nutrition, poverty alleviation and livelihood opportunities for many people around the world, in particular in developing nations. This goal measure whether people who need to fish on a small, local scale have the opportunity to do so. It has three sub-components: stock, access, and need. A score of 100 means the country or region is meeting the needs of artisanal fishermen or communities by implementing institutional supports, providing access to near-shore water, and maintaining the health of targeted species.</p>
</div>
<div id="model-data-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Model &amp; Data</h3>
<p>Status model for this goal is a function of need for artisanal fishing opportunities and whether or not the opportunity is permitted and/or encouraged institutionally and done sustainability. This <em>need</em> was measured by an analogous proxy: per capita gross domestic product (pcGDP) adjusted by the purchasing power parity (PPP), which translates the average annual income (pcGDP) into its local value (PPP). These data correlate with UN data on the percent of a population living below international poverty standard, which directly ties to this need for small-scale fishing. <em>The opportunity or ability to meet this need</em>, we used data from (Mora et al.), which scores countries on the institutional measures that support or facilitate artisanal and small-scale fishing.</p>
<p><em>The sustainability of artisanal fishing practices could be approximated by the percent of fishermenthat use sustainable gear such as hook and line versus unsustainable methods such as dynamite, cyanide and, arguably, gill net fishing. Unfortunately data on proportion of gear type used within a country is scarce at best and so we were unable to include this term in the calculation of this goal.</em></p>

<h2>Natural Products</h2>
<div id="goal-description-3" class="section level3">
<h3>Goal Description</h3>
<p>In many countries the harvest of non-food natural products is important for local economies and can also be traded internationally. The sustainable harvest of these products is therefore an important component of a healthy ocean. This goal assesses the ability of countries to maximize the sustainable harvest of living marine resources, such as corals, shells, seaweeds, and fish for the aquarium trade. It does not include bioprospecting which focuses on potential (and largely unknowable and potentially infinite) value rather than current realized value, or non-living products such as oil and gas or mining products which by definition are not sustainable.</p>
</div>
<div id="model-data-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Model &amp; Data</h3>
<p>The goal model measures the harvest level (in metric tons) for a product and the sustainability of that harvest. The <em>sustabinality factor</em> of each product was accounted for by adjusting its harvest level with a sustainability term based on the intensity of harvest per km2 of coral and/or rocky reef relative to the global maximum (its ‘<em>exposure</em>’). For ornamental fish and corals, the sustainability factor also includes the ‘<em>risk</em>’ that is associated with known unsustainable harvest practices (i.e., the intensity of cyanide fishing for ornamental fish, and any harvest of corals since they are CITES protected species).</p>
<p>Six different natural products were assessed: coral, ornamental fish, fish oil, seaweeds and marine plants, shells, and sponges. Status of sustainable harvest of each product (tonnes) was calculated individually first. The overall goal score weights the status of each product by its proportional value (US dollars) relative to other harvested products.</p>

<h2>Carbon Storage</h2>
<div id="goal-description-4" class="section level3">
<h3>Goal Description</h3>
<p>The Carbon Storage goal captures the ability of the coastal habitats to remove carbon given their carbon uptake rate and health conditions. A score of 100 means all habitats that contribute to carbon removal are still intact or have been restored and they can function to their full carbon burial potential. Highly productive coastal wetland ecosystems or seagrass store substantially large amount of carbon have the highest sequestration rates of any habitats on earth. They are also threatened by under-regulated coastal development but are amenable to restoration and conservation efforts.</p>

</div>
<div id="model-data-3" class="section level3">
<h3>Model &amp; Data</h3>
<p>Goal model measures the current ‘condition’ of habitats relative to reference conditions, weighted by the relative contribution of each habitat type to total carbon sequestration, using data from (Laffoley &amp; Grimsditch 2009) (Halpern 2015 final).</p>
<p>Three coastal habitats known to provide meaningful amounts of carbon storage were included in this goal: mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes (Halpern 2012). Habitat conditions are measured mainly by their coverage area, and their relative carbon sequestration are weighted: Mangrove as 139, Saltmarsh as 210, and Seagrass as 83 (Halpern 2015 final).</p>

<h2>Coastal Protection</h2>
<div id="goal-description-5" class="section level3">
<h3>Goal Description</h3>
<p>This goal aims to assess the amount of protection provided by marine and coastal habitats against flooding and erosion to coastal areas that people value, both inhabited (homes and other structures) and uninhabited (parks, special places, etc.). A score of 100 would indicate that these habitats are all still intact or have been restored to their reference conditions.</p>
</div>
<div id="model-data-4" class="section level3">
<h3>Model &amp; Data</h3>
<p>The CP model is based on the relative health of the habitats that provide shoreline protection, weighted by their area and protectiveness rank (Halpern 2015 final). Condition of each habitat was calculated with various methods depending on data availability, which are mostly based on coverage area. Rank weights for the protective ability of each habitat (Rk) come from previous work48 that ranks mangroves, corals and sea ice as 4, salt marshes as 3, and seagrasses as 1 (higher values are better) (Halpern 2012).</p>

<h3>Goal Description</h3>
<p>Tourism and recreation in coastal areas is a major component of thriving coastal communities and a measure of how much people value ocean systems, i.e. by traveling to coastal and ocean areas. This goal aims to capture the number of people, and the quality of their experience, visiting coastal and marine areas and attractions. A score of 100 means a region utilizes its full recreational potential without harming the ecosystem.</p>
</div>
<div id="model-data-5" class="section level3">
<h3>Model &amp; Data</h3>
<p>Assuming that the total number of people engaged in coastal tourism and recreation activities is directly correlated with employment in the tourism sector (eg. accommodation services, food and beverage services, retail trade, transportation services, and cultural, sports and recreational services), the TR model measures the proprotion of employment in tourism relative to total labor force in each country. The model also incorporated tourism competitiveness index (TTCI) from the World Economic Forum (WEF 2013) to capture the sustainability of the tourism industry (Halpern 2015).</p>

<h2>Sense of Place: Iconic Species</h2>
<div id="goal-description-9" class="section level3">
<h3>Goal Description</h3>
<p>Iconic species are those that are relevant to local cultural identity through a species’ relationship to one or more of the following: 1) traditional activities such as fishing, hunting or commerce; 2) local ethnic or religious practices; 3) existence value; and 4) locally-recognized aesthetic value (e.g., touristic attractions/common subjects for art such as whales). Habitat-forming species are not included in this definition of iconic species, nor are species that are harvested solely for economic or utilitarian purposes (even though they may be iconic to a sector or individual). This sub-goal assesses how well those species are conserved.</p>

<h2>Sense of Place: Lasting Special Places</h2>
<div id="goal-description-10" class="section level3">
<h3>Goal Description</h3>
<p>Sense of Place goal tries to capture the aspects of the coastal and marine system that people value as part of their cultural identity. This definition includes people living near the ocean and those who live far from it but still derive a sense of identity or value from knowing particular places or species exist. The sub-goal of Lasting Special Places focuses on those geographic locations that hold particular value for aesthetic, spiritual, cultural, recreational or existence reasons, and assesses how well they are protected. A score of 100 means the species and places important for cultural identity are protected and conserved.</p>

<h2>Clean Waters</h2>
<div id="goal-description-11" class="section level3">
<h3>Goal Description</h3>
<p>People value marine waters that are free of pollution and debris for aesthetic and health reasons. Contamination of waters comes from oil spills, chemicals, eutrophication, algal blooms, disease pathogens (e.g., fecal coliform, viruses, and parasites from sewage outflow), floating trash, and mass kills of organisms due to pollution. People are sensitive to these phenomena occurring in areas that they access for recreation or other purposes as well as for simply knowing that clean waters exist. The Clean Water goal captures the degree to which local waters are unpolluted by natural and human-made causes. This goal scores highest when the contamination level is zero.</p>
</div>
<div id="model-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Model</h3>
<p>CW goal score is calculated as the geometric mean of its four components: eutrophication (nutrients), chemicals, pathogens and marine debris. They are meant to represent a comprohensive list of contamination categories that are commonly considered in assessments of coastal clean waters and for which we could obtain datasets. <em>Chemical pollution</em> was measured as the average of land-based organic and inorganic pollution from agricultural pesticide use and runoff from impervious surfaces, respectively, and ocean-based pollution from commercial shipping and ports. The modeled input of land-based nitrogen input from (Halpern et al. 2008) was used as a proxy for <em>nutrient</em> input. Due to a lack of information on direct measurements of human pathogen in the coastal water, we used a proxy measure for pathogen: the number of people in coastal areas without access to improved sanitation facilities, assuming that locations with fewer people with access to improved facilities would lead to a a higher likelihood of coastal water contamination from human pathogens. The status of <em>trash pollution</em> was estimated using globally-available coastal beach cleanup data from the Ocean Conservancy, which records the weight of trash per year that were collected (Halpern 2012).</p>

<h2>Biodiversity: Species</h2>
<div id="goal-description-12" class="section level3">
<h3>Goal Description</h3>
<p>People value biodiversity in particular for its existence value. The risk of species extinction generates great emotional and moral concern for many people. As such, Biodiversity goal assesses the conservation status of species based on the best available global data. This sub-goal of Species assesses the health of all marine species present in a region, including endangered species and species in relatively good conditions. The presence of higher-risk species leads to a higher score.</p>
