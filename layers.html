<p>The following data layers are used in Ocean Health Index calculations for goal status, trend, pressures, and resilience. Values for Global were extracted from the global assessment and saved for each region to serve as a template as you gather higher-resolution data and indicators. Note that many values do not have a range because they were equally extracted from the global data layer.</p>

Total labor force is defined as those 15 years old and older who can supply labor for the production of goods and services – and includes those employed and unemployed, as well as those in the armed forces, and generally excludes homemakers and other unpaid caregivers and workers in the informal sector. For the three EEZs that fall within the China region (China, Macau, and Hong Kong), we combined the values by summing.</p>

<h4>(ao_access)</h4>
<p>This layer represents the opportunity for artisanal and recreational fishing in each country based on the quality of management of the smallscale fishing sector. Global data were extracted from Mora et al. (2009), Figure S4. Figure S4 is based on two expert opinion survey questions related to artisanal and recreational fishing (classified as small-scale fishing; presented in Table S5). Overall scores for small-scale fisheries management for each country are based on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores representing better management of the artisanal and recreational fishing sectors. These values were then rescaled (using a maximum value of 100 and minimum value of 0) to give a country score between 0 and 1 for each OHI region.</p>
<p>Questions from Mora et al. that were used to evaluate access to artisanal scale fishing.</p>
<p>If recreational fishing exists to any extent, which of the following apply: - Are recreational fishermen required to have a fishing license? Y/N - Are there regulations to the size of fish caught? Y/N - Are there regulations to the number of fish caught? Y/N - Are there regulations to the number of fishermen allowed to fish? Y/N - Are there statistics being collected for this sort of fishing? Y/N</p>

<p>Mel/Jamie</p>
<p>S1_PLoS_OHI2015.pdf: section 4.1.1 Add in RAM stuff cut stock resilience stuff</p>
<p>For this current assessment we replaced this approach with estimates of B/BMSY, the ratio of population abundance compared to the abundance required to deliver maximum sustainable yield, obtained from the catch-MSY model (Martell and Froese, in press, see the Fisheries sub-goal description for Food Provision for more details). Although both approaches use similar empirically-derived relationships on depletion levels, the current model uses more information contained in the annual catch data and produces estimates that take into account how species with different life-history traits have different levels of resilience to fishing exploitation. An important difference from the previous approach is that the output is an index on a continuous scale, and management frameworks differ in how they define what range of B/BMSY constitutes an “overfished” status, or a “depleted” status, etc. For details on how the values are converted to a score on a scale from 0 to 1, see proportion of the Fisheries sub-goal description for Food Provision. Previously stock status was only used as a sustainability coefficient for Fish Oil in the Natural Products goal; it is now an integral part of how the Fisheries sub-goal in Food Provision goal is calculated.</p>

<h1>Chemical pollution</h1>
<div id="po_chemicals" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>(po_chemicals)</h4>
<p>This pressure layer is calculated using data for land-based organic pollution (pesticide data), land-based inorganic pollution (using impermeable surfaces as a proxy), and ocean pollution (shipping and ports). These global data are provided at ~1km resolution, with values scaled from 0-1 (Halpern et al. 2008, 2015). To obtain the final pressure values, the three raster layers were summed (with cell values capped at &lt;= 1).</p>
</div>
<div id="land-based-organic-pollution" class="section level4">
<h4>Land-based organic pollution</h4>
<p>Data were calculated using modeled plumes of land-based pesticide pollution that provide intensity of pollution at 1km2 resolution (Halpern et al. 2008).</p>
<p>Organic pollution was estimated from FAO data on annual country-level pesticide use (<a href="http://faostat3.fao.org/faostat-gateway/go/to/browse/R/*/E" class="uri">http://faostat3.fao.org/faostat-gateway/go/to/browse/R/*/E</a>), measured in metric tons of active ingredients. FAO uses survey methods to measure quantities of pesticides applied to crops and seeds in the agriculture sector, and includes insecticides, mineral oils, herbicides, fungicides, seed treatments insecticides, seed treatments fungicides, plant growth regulators and rodenticides. Missing values were estimated by regression between fertilizer and pesticides (see chemical pollution: land-based organic, described above) when possible, and when not possible with agricultural GDP as a proxy. Data were summed across all pesticide compounds and reported in metric tons. Upon inspection the data included multiple 0 values that are most likely data gaps in the time-series, so they were treated as such and replaced with NA. In addition, regions with only 1 data point and regions where the most recent data point was prior to 2005 were excluded. The data gaps were then filled using coastal population trends for the corresponding reporting region. Uninhabited countries were assumed to have no pesticide use and thus excluded.</p>
<p>These country-level pollution values were then dasymetrically distributed over a country’s landscape using global landcover data from the years 2005 (for the 2003-2006 time period) and 2009 (for the 2007-2010 time period), derived from the MODIS satellite at ~500m resolution. These values were then aggregated by ~140,000 global basins, and diffusive plumes were modeled from each basin’s pourpoint. The final non-zero plumes (about ~76,000) were aggregated into ~1km Mollweide (wgs84) projection rasters to produce a single plume-aggregated pollution raster.</p>
<p>These raw values were then ln(X+1) transformed and normalized to 0-1 by dividing by the 99.99th quantile of raster values across all years. The zonal mean was then calculated for each region.</p>
</div>
<div id="land-based-inorganic-pollution" class="section level4">
<h4>Land-based inorganic pollution</h4>
<p>These data are from Halpern et al. (2008, 2015), and available from Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB, <a href="https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#view/doi:10.5063/F19021PC" class="uri">https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#view/doi:10.5063/F19021PC</a>, rescaled_2013_inorganic_mol). Non-point source inorganic pollution was modeled with global 1 km2 impervious surface area data (<a href="http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/dmsp/" class="uri">http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/dmsp/</a>) under the assumption that most of this pollution comes from urban runoff. These data will not capture point-sources of pollution or nonpoint sources where paved roads do not exist (e.g., select places in developing countries). Third, values for these three anthropogenic drivers were then aggregated to the watershed and distributed to the pour point (i.e., stream and river mouths) for the watershed with raster statistics (i.e., aggregation by watershed).</p>
</div>
<div id="ocean-pollution-shipping-lanes-ports" class="section level4">
<h4>Ocean pollution (shipping lanes, ports)</h4>
<p>These data are from Halpern et al. (2015), and available from the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB, <a href="https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#view/doi:10.5063/F1DR2SDD" class="uri">https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#view/doi:10.5063/F1DR2SDD</a>, rescaled_2013_one_ocean_pollution_mol). Ocean-based pollution is assumed to derive from commercial and recreational ship activity and combines commercial shipping traffic data (see Commercial Activity) and port data (see Invasive Species).</p>
<p>Shipping data was obtained from two sources: (1) Over the past 20 years, 10-20% of the vessel fleet has voluntarily participated in collecting meteorological data for the open ocean, which includes location at the time of measurement, as part of the Volunteer Observing System (VOS). (2) In order to improve maritime safety, in 2002 the International Maritime Organization SOLAS agreement required all vessels over 300 gross tonnage (GT) and vessels carrying passengers to equip Automatic Identification System (AIS) transceivers, which use the Global Positioning System (GPS) to precisely locate vessels.</p>
<p>Port data was obtained from using the volume (measured in tonnes) of goods transported through commercial ports as a proxy measure of port traffic. Total cargo volume data by port was collected from regional and national statistical organizations, and from published port rankings.</p>

<p>See description for chemical pollution layer [po_chemicals].</p>
<p>The inverse of the pressure data (1 - value) from the po_chemicals layer (including only the 3nm offshore region) was used to estimate chemical trends for the clean water goal. The proportional yearly change in chemical pressure values were estimated using a linear regression model of the most recent five years of data (i.e., slope divided by data from the earliest year included in the regression model). The slope was then multiplied by five to get the predicted change in 5 years.</p>
<p>The only layer with yearly data was the land-based organic pollution (pesticide data). The land-based inorganic pollution (using impermeable surfaces as a proxy) and ocean pollution (shipping and ports) remained the same.</p>

Gross Domestic Product (gdp) was obtained in US dollars from The World Bank. The World Bank defines gdp as the gross value of all resident producers in the economy plus product taxes and minus and subsidies not included in the value of the products. The gdp was then adjusted by population size to get per capita output and by Purchasing Power Parity (ppp) to account for the difference in exchange rates between countries.

<h4>(fis_meancatch)</h4>
<p>Mel/Jamie</p>
<p>Look in 2015 supplement</p>
<p>2012 Supplement: Fisheries catch data come from FAO global fisheries catch statistics, data from international and national fisheries agencies, and reconstructed catch datasets that have been spatialized to half-degree resolution in WGS84 geographic projection by the Sea Around Us Project31 and then aggregated to each reporting region. All gaps in catch reporting were treated as true zeros; six countries had poor data reporting for early years in the time series and so these were treated as zeros (Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Kenya, Sudan, Mozambique, and South Georgia &amp; Sandwich Islands). We used data from 2006 as the current estimate because they are the most recent data spatialized by the Sea Around Us Project. During rasterization, cells that spanned an EEZ boundary were allocated to the EEZ proportional to the area of the cell within the EEZ. When more than one EEZ fell within a single one of our reporting units, we calculated a weighted average based on the relative area in the particular EEZ. We smoothed annual catch data for each species using a 4-year moving window average and then summed values across all species to get the total catch for each year during 1953-2006. Smoothed values were used instead of raw reported values to reduce potential bias from values that change due to changes in reporting rather than actual changes in landings. For example, we found anomalous values in Mediterranean European countries in 2005 that were due to changes in how data were reported.</p>
<p>This data layer is derived from annual FAO fisheries wild caught statistics, which are reported by FAO major fishing areas rather than EEZs or countries, and represents total annual catch per Index reporting region for 2007-2011. The proportion of catch in each FAO major fishing area that was spatially allocated to each Sea Around Us Project reporting region (Watson et al. 2004) for 2006 (as in Halpern et al. 2008, Halpern et al. 2012) was used to spatially allocate the more recent FAO catch data. In other words, all the rules used to spatially allocate the 2006 catch data were presumed to have remained the same. A key first step for doing this spatial re-allocation of catch data over time is to resolve differences in taxonomic reporting of catch across years and regions. In some cases, FAO taxon names are different because they differ from the most current scientific naming structure used by Sea Around Us and found in FishBase (www.FishBase.org), countries have started reporting new taxa to FAO, or coarse taxonomic groupings found in FAO country reports were assigned to finer taxa by the Sea Around Us Project based on inference rules developed as part of the spatial allocation process. For all non-matching taxa in FAO, we attempted to rectify the names so that each taxon name in the FAO data was linked to a corresponding official taxonomic name used by Sea Around Us in their 2006 spatially allocated data (hereafter SAU_data). FAO reports catch at one of six different taxonomic levels. The coarsest level taxa (level one) are broad miscellaneous groups (e.g., ‘Finfishes’ or ‘Pelagic fishes’), level two consists of subphyla or subclasses (e.g., ‘Crustacea’ or ‘Elasmobranchii’), level three consists of orders (e.g., ‘Teuthida’ or ‘Rajiformes’), level four consists of families (e.g., ‘Serranidae’), level five consists of genera (e.g., ‘Thunnus’), and level six consists of species identified by their scientific binomena (e.g., ‘Thunnus obesus’). We examined (by FAO statistical area) the taxa that could not be matched and for all non-matching taxa at level six, we identified the taxon at the next closest lower taxonomic group. For example, if Clupea harengus was found in the FAO data and not in SAU_data, we first looked for the genus Clupea, and then the family Clupeidae, and so on. For non-matching taxa at level five, we first looked in SAU_data for species belonging to the genus in question. If we located species, we checked the FAO data to see if catch for those species had been reported. If not, we allocated proportionally the genus level catch in the FAO to the species in SAU_data. This mismatch occurred frequently with the genus ‘Thunnus’. In all FAO regions, relatively large quantities of ‘Thunnus’ were reported. Conversely, in SAU_data, there was much higher prevalence of individual ‘Thunnus’ species due to previous disaggregation of Thunnus genera by the Sea Around Us project. For taxa at levels 2-4, we assigned the taxa to the closest lower taxonomic group found in SAU_data. These corrections were performed based on a case-by-case inspection of mismatches, rather than an automated process, as it was not possible to generate broadly applicable rules. All taxa in the FAO data were matched to a SAU taxon. Once these naming inconsistencies were resolved, we summed the SAU_data from 2006 by species within each FAO major fishing area and matched these catches to the FAO catches in each of the most recent five years. We could then calculate the proportions of each species in the SAU_data within each EEZ in an FAO statistical area. We multiplied these proportions by the recent (2007-2011) FAO catch statistics by FAO major fishing area in order to obtain updated values per taxon per EEZ within which it was caught. The results are commercial fisheries catch time series from 1950 to 2011 at the resolution of the Sea Around Us reporting regions (i.e., EEZ or in some cases finer, see Table G). When gapfilling B/BMSY, if a country belonged to an FAO region that improved its taxonomic reporting since SAUP 2006 data, we did not apply the 36 penalties for under reporting (Eq. S3) and simply used the average of available B/BMSY estimates in those cases.</p>

<p>This layer represents the potential for harmful genetic escapement based on whether the species being cultured is native or introduced. Data come from the Mariculture Sustainability Index (MSI, Trujillo 2008). In the MSI analysis native species receive the highest score (10), while foreign and introduced species receive the lowest (1) on the premise of potential impacts to local biodiversity if these species were to escape. Use of native but non-local species were scored intermediately based on the assumption that potentially negative alterations to genetic biodiversity occur from non-local sources as well, but to a lower degree. Genetic ‘pollution’ can arise when larvae, spats or seeds escape from poorly managed hatcheries, making native species vulnerable to outbreeding depressions and/or genetic bottlenecks. The MSI reports data for 359 country-species combinations (with 53 countries represented). Where multiple scores exist for a country the weighted average of all scores (0-10) is used. All country scores were then rescaled from 0 to 1, using the maximum raw score of 10 and minimum of 1. Countries that were not analyzed by Trujillo did not receive a score and this pressure layer falls out of their analyses.</p>

<h4>Coral</h4>
<p>Condition was calculated using current condition data divided by reference condition. We use condition data from percent live coral cover from 12,634 surveys from 1975-2006 (Bruno and Selig 2007, Schutte et al. 2010). When multiple data points are available for the same site and year, we average these data, and also average the site data to calculate a per country per year average. However, data were missing for several countries and some countries did not have data for the reference or current year time periods or had only 1-2 surveys. Because coral cover can be highly temporally and spatially dynamic, having only a few surveys that may have been motivated by different reasons (i.e., documenting a pristine or an impacted habitat) can bias results. To calculate condition we used fitted values from a linear trend of all data per country, which was more robust to data poor situations and allowed us to take advantage of period of intense sampling that did not always include both current and reference years. Then, we create a fitted linear model of all these data points in 1975-2010, provided that 2 or more points are in 1980-1995 and 2 or more points are in 2000-2010. We defined the ‘current’ condition (health) as the mean of the predicted values for 2008-2010, and the reference condition as the mean of the predicted values for 1985-1987. Where country data were not available, we used an average from adjacent EEZs weighted by habitat area, or a georegional average weighted by habitat area, based on countries within the same ocean basin (Figure).</p>

Reference condition was calculated as the mean of the three oldest years between 1975-1985, or the two earliest years if needed. If data responding to these conditions was not available, we fitted a linear model to all data points, and then used the mean of the predicted values for 1979-1981 as the reference condition. For the current condition we used the mean of the three most recent years after 2000 or the two most recent years. If condition data satisfying these constraints were still not available, we fitted a linear model to all data points, provided that there were at least three data points and then used the mean of the predicted values for 2008-2010 as the current condition and the mean of the predicted values for 1979-1981 as the reference condition. Otherwise, we used neighboring (adjacent) regional averages, weighted by habitat area, or averages weighted by habitat area using seagrass geographical regions as defined by Hemminga and Duarte (2000). We did not project beyond a 15-year timeframe.</p>

<div id="soft-bottom-subtidal" class="section level4">
<h4>Soft-bottom subtidal</h4>
<p>To estimate status of this habitat, we used intensity of trawl fishing relative to soft-bottom subtidal habitat as a proxy. Spatialized catch data (0.5 degree raster) are available from the global catch database of the Sea Around Us project, which uses data from FAO global fisheries catch statistics, data from international and national fisheries agencies, and reconstructed catch datasets (Zeller and Pauly 2007). The proportion of catch by fishing gear type was estimated at 0.5 degree resolution based on global taxon-gear associations (Watson et al. 2006a,b, Halpern 2008). These data were used to calculate catch (tonnes per year) from trawling for each year. Trawling gears were defined as dredges, hand dredges, bottom trawls, and shrimp trawls (mid-water trawls were excluded). These catches were assumed to be uniform within each half degree cell. We aggregated by summing the trawled catch data by reporting region for each year, and converted to catch density by dividing annual catch by the trawlable (soft-bottom) habitat. ‘Trawlable habitat’ within a region was defined as shallow subtidal (0-60m) and outer shelf (60-200m) soft bottom habitat. Because these data were extremely skewed, we ln(X+1) transformed them and then rescaled to the 95th quantile value from all year-country possibilities. Condition was then calculated as one minus the rescaled catch density in the most recent year. The condition value was then rescaled to the median intensity density value across all years, and any value greater than the median was set = 1.0.</p>

We used data from Short if there were at least 3 data points between 2001-2010. If this condition was not met, we calculated trends from Waycott for the most recent 10 years after 1990 or else we used the mean of the trend in the adjacent regions or the regions within the corresponding seagrass geographical regions using the same methods described above for the in status.</p>

<p>Salt marsh data per country come from multiple sources (Bridgham et al. 2006, Dahl 2000, Ministry for the Environment 2007, JNCC 2004, EEA 2008) and are generally reported as habitat area. In the case of Europe, most data were obtained via the European Environment Agency databases housing information pertaining to the European Union’s Habitat Directive.</p>
<p>Severe data gaps exist for several key regions of the world, including the Middle East, South America, and Africa. Extensive salt marshes are believed to exist in the Middle East, bordering the unique salt flat ecosystems known as sabkha, however no numbers concerning extent could be found. Similarly, data on salt marshes in South America were extremely limited, with no estimates on current rates of loss or historical extent from or before the 1970s. The majority of the data included in the model come from North America (United States and Canada), Australia, New Zealand, China, Europe, and the United Kingdom.</p>

<div id="sea-ice-2" class="section level4">

These raster data are 25km in resolution (625km2 per pixel) in a Stereographic polar projection. Two sea ice metrics are calculated using these data: sea-ice edge and sea ice shoreline (shoreline pixels with &gt;15% ice cover). Calculations of area are based on 3-year averages (to smooth yearly variation, e.g., 2009 data is the average of 2008-2010) of the pixels meeting the habitat criteria.</p>

<p>From OHI2105_methods_update_final: For this layer, we used updated Sea Around Us Project (SAUP) catch reconstruction data and new net primary productivity data. The new SAUP data were available only at the country scale and did not differentiate catch by gear type. To estimate high resolution catch data by gear type we used the original global (0.5 degree resolution) catch by gear spatial data provided by the SAUP for Halpern et al. (2008) to calculate the proportion of catch caught by high and low bycatch gears within each raster cell. The updated global catch from the Sea Around Us Project for the years 2006-2010 was summarized per EEZ and FAO region and then distributed across the respective region based on the proportion catch with each raster cell for high and low bycatch gear. This method assumes that proportion of catch per gear type has remained constant within a region, although absolute catch can change. The layer was then standardized by average net primary production (VGPM) over the same years, 2006 to 2010. Updating the NPP data had not been done previously. Data was log transformed and then normalized by using the 99.99th quantile.</p>
<p>Description from S1_PLoS_OHI2015:</p>
<p>The most recent spatially-explicit global estimates of catch by gear type were developed and used in Halpern et al. (2008), where catch was allocated to 5 different gear types at half-degree resolution, and have not been updated since. To estimate changes in this pressure, we used the spatially-allocated catch data (see 5.68 below) and calculated the percent change in total annual catch per reporting region as the difference between the most recent reporting period (2009 to 2011) and the period (1999 to 2003) previously used by Halpern et al. (2008), divided by the original period (1999 to 2003). Each of the three high-bycatch 1km raster layers (Halpern et al. 2008) was then multiplied by the percent change specific to each Sea Around Us reporting region to create estimates of current spatially-explicit catch by gear type. Although this calculation requires the unlikely assumption that the proportional amount of catch per Sea Around Us reporting region has remained the same over the past 10 years, we felt it better to make this assumption than to assume fishing pressure has not changed at all. Overall pressure per gear class per Index reporting region was then calculated as the mean of all 1km pixel values within the region for each of the two time periods. The maximum possible score (which is used to rescale all values 0-1) was then determined as 110% of the maximum regional score across either time period, such that all regions were rescaled to the same value. For each pressure layer the maximum came from the previous time period (1999-2003; Halpern et al. 2008; Halpern et al. 2012). As was done previously (Halpern et al. 2012), high bycatch commercial fishing was then measured as the average of demersal destructive (e.g., trawl), demersal non-destructive high bycatch (e.g., pots, traps) and pelagic high bycatch (e.g., long-line) gear.</p>

<p>Casey: can you review this, and if you think it is necessary, add information about how the IUCN status data was harvested (or other relevant details)?</p>
<p>This data layer provides the risk category and the year the species was assessed from the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (<a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/" class="uri">http://www.iucnredlist.org/</a>) for the iconic species in each region. In some cases, we were able to use regionally specific IUCN status data for subpopulations.</p>
<p>The OHI global iconic species list was created by combining three species lists from WWF Global: global priorities, regional and local priorities, and flagship species. The criteria for including species within those WWF lists overlapped with key points from OHI’s definition of iconic species. OHI defines iconic species as species recognized as relevant to local cultural identity through the species’ relationship to traditional activities such as fishing, hunting, commerce or involvement in local ethnic or religious practices; and species with locally-recognized aesthetic value (e.g., touristic attractions/common artistic subjects such as whales). Habitat forming species were not included in this definition of iconic species. Lists were not used when the only criteria for species inclusion included that the species are impacted by human activities or have a threatened population status. Once the species lists were obtained, each species was assigned to a region based on range countries from the IUCN Red List. Additionally, national priority and flagship species lists were included for those specific countries only.</p>
<p>Most of the iconic species are not region specific (i.e., a global list was created that is applied to most regions). However, as more regional assessments are conducted (<a href="http://ohi-science.org/projects/" class="uri">http://ohi-science.org/projects/</a>), we will use the iconic species list developed by those countries/regions in our model.</p>

<h1>Jobs for each sector and year</h1>
<div id="le_jobs_sector_year" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>(le_jobs_sector_year)</h4>
<p>This layer includes yearly data for jobs in commercial fishing, mariculture, marine mammal watching, marine renewable energy, and, tourism. The data sources and methods for each sector are described below.</p>
</div>
<div id="commercial-fishing" class="section level4">
<h4>Commercial fishing</h4>
<p>Data come from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Fisheries and Aquaculture Department which provides a Global Number of Fishers (GNF) (<a href="http://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/global-fishers/en" class="uri">http://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/global-fishers/en</a>.) The data contains yearly total numbers of employees in commercial fishing, subsistence fishing, and aquaculture (land- and ocean-based combined) in more than 160 countries. The dataset includes the following occupational categories: aquatic-life cultivation, inland waters fishing, marine coastal waters fishing, marine deepsea waters fishing, subsistence and unspecified. We omitted jobs with an unspecified category to avoid overestimating employment for marine fishing or aquaculture. We omitted jobs in the subsistence category since subsistence opportunities are captured by the artisanal fishing opportunity goal of the OHI and in the aquatic-life cultivation category since that represents a distinct sector (see mariculture below). For commercial fishing, we eliminated inland waters fishing and summed marine coastal waters and marine deep-sea waters fishing for each country in each year. Data are reported separately for men and women, but we summed these numbers. Employment is disaggregated into full-time, parttime, occasional, and unspecified statuses. These categories are defined as full time workers having &gt; 90% of their time or livelihood from fishing/aquaculture, part time workers are between 30-90% time (or 30-90% of their livelihood) and occasional workers are &lt; 30% time. Unspecified status workers could fall anywhere from 0-100% time. Taking the midpoints of those ranges, we assume that 1 part time worker = 0.6 full time workers, 1 occasional worker = 0.15 full time workers, and 1 unspecified worker = 0.5 full time workers, which we used as a weighting scheme for determining total numbers of jobs. The data also contain significant gaps, but they provide the most comprehensive source of global data on commercial fishing and aquaculture employment.</p>
</div>
<div id="mariculture" class="section level4">
<h4>Mariculture</h4>
<p>We used the FAO GNF dataset (see Marine jobs: commercial fishing above for full dataset description) to estimate jobs for mariculture. For this sector, we used data in the aquatic-life cultivation category. Again, employment is disaggregated into full-time, part-time, occasional, and unspecified statuses and we implement a weighting scheme where full time = 1 job, part-time = 0.6, occasional = 0.15, and unspecified = 0.5. Aquatic-life cultivation includes marine, brackish and freshwater aquaculture. In order to estimate the proportion of total aquaculture jobs that can be attributed to marine and brackish aquaculture, we used country-specific proportions of marine and brackish aquaculture revenues (compared to total revenues) calculated from FAO aquaculture production data (obtained from FishStat), assuming that numbers of jobs approximately scale with production in terms of revenue. For country-years where there were no data for the proportion of marine/brackish production because of gaps in the FAO production data, we used the proportion from the most recent year for which data were available. For countries for which we did not have proportion estimates from any years, we used the average proportion from the country’s geographic region (e.g., Caribbean, Polynesia, Eastern Asia), with the exception of American Samoa, for which we used the proportion value from Guam.</p>
</div>
<div id="marine-mammal-watching" class="section level4">
<h4>Marine mammal watching</h4>
<p>The International Fund for Animal Welfare’s (IFAW) Whale Division provides time series data on whale watching in more than 115 coastal countries (O’Connor et al 2009). This dataset may be an imperfect representation of all marine mammal watching due to its focus on whales, although it does include data for other types of marine mammal watching (e.g., dolphins). However, to our knowledge, it is the most complete dataset pertaining to the global marine mammal watching industry. We obtained regional averages of the number of whale watchers per employee, as well as the number of whale watchers in each country. Using this information, we estimated the number of whale watching jobs in each country by dividing the country’s total number of whale watchers by the average number of whale watchers per employee for that country’s region (e.g., Africa &amp; Middle East, Europe, North America). It is important to note that data are not annual, but there are at least four years of data for each country. When IFAW reported “minimal” numbers of whale watchers, we converted this description to a 0 for lack of additional information. Because some of the whale watching in O’Connor et al. focused on freshwater cetacean viewing, we categorized the target species listed for each country as freshwater or marine. For countries with both marine and freshwater species, we categorized the whale watching in those countries as either 50% or 90% marine, based on the number of marine versus freshwater target species and information provided in the report narrative. For Colombia and Indonesia, more detailed information in the report narrative allowed for a more precise determination of the percentage of marine-based whale watching. We applied these marine proportions to data on the number of whale watchers before converting these estimates into employment estimates.</p>
</div>
<div id="marine-renewable-energy" class="section level4">
<h4>Marine renewable energy</h4>
<p>For the two countries, France and Canada, which produce significant enough amounts of tidal energy to register with the UN Energy Statistics Database we estimated numbers of employees. For the La Rance plant in France, this information was obtained from a recent press statement (EDF 2011); we assumed employment stayed constant over the time period for which we had production data for this plant, given relatively consistent or even growing production. For the Annopolis Royal plant in Canada, we received information from the plant about employment over time (Ruth Thorbourne, personal communication, Aug 9 2011).</p>
<p>A note on marine renewable energy, which is an expanding industry with many positive and negative effects on humans and ecosystems beyond the actual energy harnessed (Lam &amp; Roy 2014). Marine renewable energy includes five major technologies: tidal barrages, marine currents, waves, ocean thermal converters and salinity gradients. In global-scale Index assessments, marine renewable energy includes data only for the largest tidal barrage plants, as these data are available. These data are represented only as marine revenue and marine jobs at two plants capturing tidal energy: La Rance Tidal Power Station (France) and Annapolis Royal Generating Station (Canada). These two plants have large enough energy production to be included in the United Nations Energy Statistics database (<a href="http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=EDATA&amp;f=cmID%3aEO">http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=EDATA&amp;f=cmID%3aEO</a>) and have multiple years of data (Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Station in South Korea, the world’s largest tidal power station only became operational in 2011 and could not be included for this reason). Marine renewable energy can also act as pressures and resilience on other goals within OHI; the details of these tradeoffs are very site-specific and best incorporated at regional assessment scales (e.g. Elfes et al. 2014) where information may be available on interactions over time.</p>
</div>
<div id="tourism" class="section level4">
<h4>Tourism</h4>
<p>The World Travel &amp; Tourism Council (WTTC) provides data on travel and tourism’s total contribution to employment for 180 countries (<a href="http://www.wttc.org/eng/Tourism_Research/Economic_Data_Search_Tool/" class="uri">http://www.wttc.org/eng/Tourism_Research/Economic_Data_Search_Tool/</a>). Although other global data sources on tourism are available (i.e., United Nations World Tourism Organization [UNTWO]), the WTTC database was chosen because it offers yearly time series data that span through the current year, it includes nearly complete coverage of all nations, and it disaggregates direct and total (direct plus indirect) employment impacts of tourism. WTTC provides projected data, however, we do not use these values. We used total employment data to avoid the use of literature derived multiplier effects. The WTTC shares a significant drawback with UNTWO data, in that data on coastal/marine and inland tourism are lumped. Therefore, a country-specific coefficient must be applied to estimate the jobs provided by coastal/marine tourism alone. We adjusted national tourism data by the proportion of a country’s population that lives within a 25 mile inland coastal zone.</p>

<p>Mariculture production comes from the FAO Global Aquaculture Production Quantity dataset. Only production classified in the “Marine” and “Brackishwater” environments were included in the analysis (all “Freshwater” production was excluded). Seaweeds were excluded because they are included in the natural products goal. All species produced within a country were summed to give a single production value for each country in each year that production took place. For the three EEZs that fall within the China region (China, Macau, and Hong Kong), we combined the values by summing across these EEZs.</p>

<p>See mar_sustainability_score for more information about these data.</p>
<p>Two mariculture practice criteria from the Marine Sustainability Index (Trujillo 2008) contributed to the resilience of mariculture (traceability and code of practice). These are the only 2 social criteria assessed in the MSI that have the potential to positively affect the long term resilience of a mariculture system.</p>
<p>The MSI reports data for 359 country-species combinations (with 60 countries and 86 species represented) for each assessment criterion. Scores for each assessment criterion were aggregated and averaged. All country average scores were then rescaled from 0 to 1 using the maximum possible raw MSI score of 10 and minimum of 1, and then weighted equally to come up with a composite resilience.</p>
<p>Unlike the mariculture sustainability data (mar_sustainability_score layer), gapfilling was not performed when country specific data were not available for the two resilience measures because these measures are social in nature and reliant on the specific decisions made by each country rather than on the species cultured. As such, it was decided that crosscountry species averages were not appropriate to use in the gap filling process for resilience.</p>

<h4>(mar_sustainability_score)</h4>
<p>Three mariculture practice criteria from the Marine Sustainability Index (Trujillo 2008) contributed to the sustainability of mariculture (fishmeal use, waste treatment, and seed and larvae origin criteria). These criteria represent the internal mariculture practices with the potential to affect the long term sustainability of the mariculture system. The MSI reports data for 359 country-species combinations (with 60 countries and 86 species represented) for each assessment criterion. Scores for each assessment criterion were aggregated and averaged based on the proportion of the landings that each assessed species contributed to the overall catch in each country in the current year. All country average scores were then rescaled from 0 to 1 using the maximum possible raw MSI score of 10 and minimum of 1, and then weighted equally to come up with a composite resilience. Because the Index comprises species-specific sustainability values that are combined as a catch-weighted average, when the list of species harvested changed, the sustainability index used in the mariculture sub-goal model also changes due to shifts in the relative composition of harvested species.</p>
<p>Gap filling for countries not originally assessed in the MSI was done by applying the average cross-country score for a species if that specific species or a similar species was assessed in another country. Also, when a country had less than 60% of its catch represented by an MSI score (based on FAO landings data) gap filling was used by applying the average crosscountry score for the same or very similar species cultured in other countries.</p>

<h4>(np_harvest_tonnes)</h4>
<p>The total tonnes of six natural product commodities (corals, ornamental fish, shells, fish oil, seaweeds and plants, and sponges) were determined for each region using export data from the FAO Global Commodities database. For each group the sum of the subcategories was calculated. For ornamental fish we excluded the subcategory ‘Fish for culture including ova, fingerlings, etc.’ because it is not specific to ornamental fish and the subcategory ‘Ornamental freshwater fish’ because it is not from marine systems. Corals and shells are reported together in nine subcategories; we used the subcategories most closely tied to each, leading to the sum of two subcategories for corals and seven subcategories for shells (one subcategory was used for both). We did not use one subcategory – ‘Powder and waste of shells’ – as it likely a byproduct of the other subcategories rather than a primary target (and it comprises a very small amount of the total anyway).</p>
<p>If a country was missing tonnes or dollar values (but had one of the values), the missing data were estimated. FAO provides yearly data for the tonnes and dollar value generated for each natural product, however, countries often provide only one of these variables (and the data provided varies across years). To estimate these missing data, we used country-specific linear models to predict tonnes based on the dollar value of a product (or, vice versa). For the countries that did not have enough data to develop an adequate model, our models included the data for all the countries within a georegion. When there wasn’t enough data at the georegion scale, we used all the global data to predict missing values.</p>

<p>These data come from the global invasive species database (Molnar et al. 2008). The database reports number and type of alien species in each marine ecoregion (Spalding et al. 2007), with species types categorized as invasive and harmful invasive species. For our purposes, total count of all invasive species was used. We intersected the ecoregion data with our reporting units to determine the proportion of each ecoregion that falls within each reporting unit and then assigned this percentage of invasive species from the ecoregion to the reporting unit. The sum of all invasive species within each reporting unit was then rescaled to the maximum global value. Predicting the full potential impact of alien species depends in large part on having high-resolution spatial information on where they exist, how far they have spread and exactly which components of the food web they affect. The data from Molnar et al. approximate these impacts but at ecoregional scales. In addition, the impacts of alien species will vary depending on the goal under consideration. This implies that harmful effects would need to be assessed separately for each goal. Such an endeavor may be possible when applying this framework to a smaller case-study where this type of information can be acquired.</p>

<p>Data were calculated using modeled plumes of land-based nitrogen pollution that provide intensity of pollution at 1km2 resolution (Halpern et al. 2008).</p>
<p>Nitrogen pollution was estimated from FAO data on annual country-level fertilizer use (<a href="http://faostat3.fao.org/faostat-gateway/go/to/browse/R/*/E" class="uri">http://faostat3.fao.org/faostat-gateway/go/to/browse/R/*/E</a>), with missing values estimated by regression between fertilizer and pesticides (see chemical pollution: land-based organic, described above) when possible, and when not possible with agricultural GDP as a proxy. Data were summed across all fertilizer compounds and reported in metric tons. Upon inspection the data included multiple 0 values that are most likely data gaps in the time-series, so they were treated as such and replaced with NA. In addition, regions with only 1 data point and regions where the most recent data point was prior to 2005 were excluded. The data gaps were then filled using coastal population trends for the corresponding reporting region. Uninhabited countries were assumed to have no fertilizer use and thus excluded.</p>
<p>These country-level pollution values were then dasymetrically distributed over a country’s landscape using global landcover data from the years 2005 (for the 2003-2006 time period) and 2009 (for the 2007-2010 time period), derived from the MODIS satellite at ~500m resolution. These values were then aggregated by ~140,000 global basins, and diffusive plumes were modeled from each basin’s pourpoint. The final non-zero plumes (about ~76,000) were aggregated into ~1km Mollweide (wgs84) projection rasters to produce a single plume-aggregated pollution raster.</p>
<p>These raw values were then ln(X+1) transformed and normalized to 0-1 by dividing by the 99.99th quantile of raster values across all years. The zonal mean was then calculated for each region.</p>

<p>This layer includes yearly data for revenue in commercial fishing, aquarium trade fishing, mariculture, marine mammal watching, marine renewable energy, and, tourism. The data sources and methods for each sector are described below.</p>
</div>
<div id="aquarium-trade-fishing" class="section level4">
<h4>Aquarium trade fishing</h4>
<p>To approximate revenue from aquarium fishing we used export data from the FAO Global Commodities database for ‘Ornamental fish’ for all available years. We used data from two of the four subcategories listed, excluding the subcategory ‘Fish for culture including ova, fingerlings, etc.’ because it is not specific to ornamental fish and the subcategory ‘Ornamental freshwater fish’ because it is not from marine systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="commercial-fishing-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Commercial fishing</h4>
<p>Revenue data for commercial fishing were obtained from FAO’s FishStat database, which provides yearly dollar values of commercial fisheries production in marine, brackish and fresh waters starting in 1950 and updated yearly. Data are given by species, so to isolate marine and brackish fishery production, data were omitted that pertained to freshwater species. This species classification process was very time consuming, and thus was only conducted in 5 year increments, providing data for 1997, 2002 and 2007.</p>
</div>
<div id="mariculture-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Mariculture</h4>
<p>Data on revenues from marine aquaculture were derived from FAO’s FishStat database, which includes country-level data on total production values (marine, brackish, and freshwater) of aquaculture beginning in 1984 and updated yearly. To isolate production values attributable to marine and brackish aquaculture, data pertaining to freshwater species were omitted. This species classification process was very time consuming as each species had to be queried individually per year. There was little year-to year variation, and thus data were extracted in 5 year increments, providing data for 1997, 2002 and 2007.</p>
</div>
<div id="marine-mammal-watching-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Marine mammal watching</h4>
<p>IFAW (see jobs_sector_year layer) provides time series (for at least four years between 1991 and 2008), country-level data on total expenditures (including direct and indirect) attributable to the whale watching industry (O’Connor et al. 2009). Here, total expenditures are used as a close proxy for total revenue. We used total expenditure data (direct and indirect expenditures) to avoid using a literature derived multiplier effect. When IFAW reported “minimal” revenue from whale watching, we converted this description to a 0 for lack of additional information. For countries with both marine and freshwater cetacean viewing, we adjusted by the proportion marine as described for the jobs dataset.</p>
</div>
<div id="marine-renewable-energy-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Marine renewable energy</h4>
<p>The United Nations Energy Statistics Database provides production data, in kilowatt-hours (KWh), for tidal and wave electricity. However, only two countries, France and Canada, have high enough levels of production to be reported in this data source both for tidal energy production. For Canada, production data were replaced with production data (Gross Megawatt hours per year from 1995-2010) provided directly from the Annapolis tidal power plant because the plant provided a longer time series (Ruth Thorbourne, personal communication, Aug 9, 2011). To convert production data into revenue, production values were multiplied by average yearly prices of electricity per KWh specific to Canada and France, provided by the US Energy Information Administration (<a href="http://www.eia.gov/emeu/international/elecprii.html" class="uri">http://www.eia.gov/emeu/international/elecprii.html</a>; updated June 2010) after conversion to 2010 USD. Some of the production data could not be used because there were not available electricity price data to convert production into revenue, truncating our time series.</p>
</div>
<div id="tourism-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Tourism</h4>
<p>WTTC (see jobs_sector_year layer) also reports time series data on the dollar values of visitor exports (spending by foreign visitors) and domestic travel and tourism spending; combining these two data sets creates a proxy for total travel and tourism revenues. WTTC was chosen as the source for tourism revenue data because of the near-complete country coverage, the yearly time series component starting in 1988 and updated yearly, and the inclusion of both foreign and domestic expenditures. This dataset, like that for tourism jobs described above, lumps inland and coastal/marine revenues, and so was adjusted with the same coastal coefficient (percent of a country’s population within a 25 mile inland coastal zone) as the jobs data. We included no projected data. We used total contribution to GDP data (rather than direct contribution to GDP) to avoid the use of literature derived multiplier effects.</p>

Monthly mean sea level anomalies from 1993 through 2015 track changes in sea level (mm) compared to a reference period from 1993-2012. Raw monthly data are provided on a 0.25x0.25 degree grid. After downloading, the data were subsequently clipped to within 3 nautical miles of the coast, and monthly data layers were aggregated and averaged across pixels to compute mean sea level anomalies. All annual layers were then stacked and the 99.99th quantile of the entire dataset was used as the reference point to rescale the layer from 0 to 1. All negative values were set to zero (i.e., no negative pressure), such that only positive sea level rise values mattered.</p>

<h4>(cc_sst)</h4>
<p>Sea surface temperature (SST) data were obtained from the Coral Reef Temperature Anomaly Database (CoRTAD) (Casey et al. 2015), which is produced by the NOAA National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI) using 4.6 km (nominally 21 km^2 at the equator) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Pathfinder Version 5.2 SST data (<a href="http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/sog/cortad/" class="uri">http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/sog/cortad/</a>). Weekly SST data are used to compute the standard deviation (SD) of SST’s per pixel across all years. We define an anomaly as exceeding the standard deviation of SSTs from the climatology for that location (i.e., grid cell) and week of the year. The frequency of weekly anomalies was calculated for each year in the dataset. We then quantified the difference between the number of anomalies in the 5 most recent years and the 5 oldest years in the dataset.</p>
<p>Because SST measurements are less reliable where there is persistent ice, we created an ice mask to identify places near the poles that were almost always covered by significant sea ice. The ice mask was generated primarily from the OSI/SAF Global Daily Sea Ice Concentration Reprocessing Data Set (accession.nodc.noaa.gov/0068294), which was regridded and made available in the Pathfinder V5.2 dataset. In Pathfinder, when the OSI/SAF data are unavailable, the sea ice concentrations from the NCDC Daily OI SST data (Reynolds et al. 2007) are included. For each day of the climatological year (1 through 366), we read in the daily sea ice fraction for that day from all of the years and averaged them to create a daily, sea-ice fraction climatology. We then identified grid cells that always contained a sea ice fraction of greater than 0.15 and masked them out of the analysis.</p>

We take an average of the six dimension scores to produce a single governance score for each country to use as the social resilience measure.

The index analyzes 140 countries and scores each based on three sub-indices: Human, Cultural, and Natural Resources; Business Environment and Infrastructure; and Regulatory Framework. These three sub-indices are in turn composed of 14 “pillars” of Travel &amp; Tourism Competitiveness that are informed by a multitude of individual indicators based on the World Economic Forum’s annual Executive Opinion Survey and hard data from publically available sources: Human, Cultural, and Natural Resources (human resources, affinity for travel and tourism, natural resources, and cultural resources); Business Environment and Infrastructure (air transport infrastructure, ground transport infrastructure, tourism infrastructure, ICT infrastructure, and price competitiveness in the industry); and Regulatory Framework (policy rules and regulations, environmental sustainability, safety and security, health and hygiene, and prioritization of travel and tourism). Because these indicators are meant to represent the overall quality and future potential of the tourism sector within a country, we assume these indicators to be representative of the long term sustainability of the tourism sector within each country.

<p>The UN geopolitical region classification of OHI regions (United Nations Statistics Division, 2016; <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm" class="uri">http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm</a>). These data are often used for gapfilling missing data. Level r0 is the most general classification, and all OHI regions have the same classification (World), r1 is more specific, and there are seven geopolitical classes (Africa, Americas, etc.), and r2 is the most specific with 22 geopolitical classes (Caribbean, Central America, etc.).</p>

Penalty scores were based on the urgency of warning (‘risk’=0.25, ‘avoid unnecessary travel’=0.75, and ‘avoid all travel’ = 1). Penalties for region-specific warnings (within a country) were assessed at half the weight.</p>

<p>The ultraviolet radiation (UV) pressure layer is derived from daily Local Noon Erythemal UV Irradiance (mW/m^2) data. The Aura/OMI satellite provides data at 1x1 degree resolution from September 2004 through present, spanning 180 degrees latitude and 360 degrees longitude. Raster data is provided in HDF5 format by the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GESDISC), available here: <a href="http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/data-holdings/OMI/omuvbd_v003.shtml" class="uri">http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/data-holdings/OMI/omuvbd_v003.shtml</a>. Raw data was downloaded, translated to GeoTIFFs using R and aggregated to weekly means.</p>
<p>This pressure measures the number of times the weekly average of each 1 degree cell exceeds the climatological mean + 1 standard deviation, defined as an anomalous value. The frequency of weekly anomalies was calculated for each year in the dataset. We then quantified the difference between the number of anomalies in the 5 most recent years and the 5 oldest years in the dataset.</p>

<p>We used the Occupational Wages around the World (OWW) database produced by Remco H. Oostendorp and Richard B. Freeman in 2005 (<a href="http://www.nber.org/oww/" class="uri">http://www.nber.org/oww/</a>). These data were drawn from the International Labour Organization and subjected to a standardization process (for more information, see <a href="http://www.nber.org/oww/Technical" class="uri">http://www.nber.org/oww/Technical</a> _document_1983-2003_standardizationv3.pdf). The database provides several different calibrations, and we use the “x3wl calibration”, described by the database creators as a “country-specific and uniform calibration with lexicographic weighting,” and recommended as being the preferred calibration in most cases. Although significant gaps exist in this database, it contains country-specific information on average wages in many industries for more than 150 countries from 1983-2003. Data represent average monthly wages of a male worker. Wage data were divided by the inflation conversion factor for 2010 so that wage data across years would be comparable (<a href="http://oregonstate.edu/cla/polisci/sahr/sahr" class="uri">http://oregonstate.edu/cla/polisci/sahr/sahr</a>), and then multiplied by the purchasing power parity-adjusted per capita GDP (ppppcgdp, WorldBank). The adjusted wage data were then multiplied by 12 to get annual wages. We used the industry and occupation classifications reported in the OWW to estimate wages for marine-related sectors.</p>
