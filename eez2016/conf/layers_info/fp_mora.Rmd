These data come from Mora et al. (2009), and assess the current effectiveness of fisheries management regimes along 6 axes: Scientific Robustness, Policy Transparency, Implementation Capacity, Subsidies, Fishing Effort, and Foreign Fishing. All countries with coastal areas were assessed through a combination of surveys, empirical data and enquiries to fisheries experts. For each OHI reporting region, scores for each category were rescaled between 0 and 1 using the maximum possible value for each category and then the average score of all 6 categories combined was recorded as the overall Fisheries management effectiveness score.
