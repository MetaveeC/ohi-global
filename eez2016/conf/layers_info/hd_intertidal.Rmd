Make this general enough for intertidal, mariculture, and ???

Most recent:
Data source was changed from a Gridded Population of the World grid of future estimated population density to future estimated population count grid at 2.5 arc-minute resolution.  Population was extracted directly against a 25-mile coastal zone shapefile rather than rasterizing both sources to a 1 km Mollweide grid, as had been done previously. Where modeled coastal population exceeded World Bank reported total population, World Bank figures were used.

old description:

Coastal population density data within 25 miles of the shore were used as a proxy for intertidal habitat destruction.  These data were extracted from the gridded population of the world dataset (CIESIN 2005) using only the UN-adjusted population counts and density (1990, 1995, and 2000), not population projections. We then rescaled the data using log-linear scale transformation with the maximum global score coming from the 2000 dataset. 

PLos_OHI2015:
Coastal population, defined as the total population inland of 25 miles, was based on the Gridded Population of the World (GPW) Population Density Grid Future Estimates, v3. These data were accessed from the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN)/Columbia University (CIESIN & CIAT 2005). Rasters of population density (number of people per square kilometer) at 2.5 arc-minute resolution were globally available for 2005, 2010, and 2015. Years in between those provided were temporally interpolated. For instance, d2013 = 0.4 * d2010 + 0.6 * d2015. For each year, rasters were projected to 1 km Mollweide, converted to units of total population per cell at the new resolution and summed per region within the 25 mi inland area For the following 19 small island regions, coastal populations were set to the total population due to lack of sufficient resolution from the input rasters (see layer 5.71. Total population): Amsterdam Island and Saint Paul Island, Bassas da India, Bouvet Island, British Indian Ocean Territory, Clipperton Island, Crozet Islands, Glorioso Islands, Heard and McDonald Islands, Ile Europa, Ile Tromelin, Jan Mayen, Johnston Atoll, Juan de Nova Island, Kerguelen Islands, Macquarie Island, Palmyra Atoll, Prince Edward Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, Wake Island.
