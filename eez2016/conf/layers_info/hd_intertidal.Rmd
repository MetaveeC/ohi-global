old description:

Coastal population density data within 25 miles of the shore were used as a proxy for intertidal habitat destruction.  These data were extracted from the gridded population of the world dataset (CIESIN 2005) using only the UN-adjusted population counts and density (1990, 1995, and 2000), not population projections. We then rescaled the data using log-linear scale transformation with the maximum global score coming from the 2000 dataset.
