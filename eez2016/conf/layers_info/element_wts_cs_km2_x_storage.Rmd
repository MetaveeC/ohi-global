This layer describes the relative value of the habitats in each region to carbon storage. These data are called internally by ohicore functions (see: conf/config.R to see how these data are specified) to weight the data used to calculate pressure and resilience values. These data are created by multiplying habitat extent by the amount of carbon the habitats sequester (Laffoley & Grimsditch 2009).

Habitat | Carbon storage
------------- | -------------
Mangrove | 139
Saltmarsh | 210 
Seagrass | 83
