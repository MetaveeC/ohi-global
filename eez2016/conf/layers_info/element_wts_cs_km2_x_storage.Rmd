This layer describes the relative value of the habitats to the carbon storage goal in each region. These data are called internally by ohicore functions (see: conf/config.R to see how these data are specified) to weight the the data used to calculate pressure and resilience values. These data are created by multiplying habitat extent by the amount of carbon the folllowing habitats sequester (Laffoley & Grimsditch 2009): mangrove (offshore and inland 1km), saltmarsh, and seagrass.

habitat | carbon storage
------- | --------------
mangrove | 139
salt marsh | 210
seagrass | 83
