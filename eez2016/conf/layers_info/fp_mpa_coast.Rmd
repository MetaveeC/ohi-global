This resilience score (values ranging from 0-1) is calculated using the lasting special places status subgoal model.  The total marine protected area (km2) within 3 nm offshore is determined (see the lsp_prot_area_offshore3nm data layer for information about the data). Following to the lasting special places model, a reference point of 30% is used, such that any region with 30%, or more, protected area receives a score of 1.
