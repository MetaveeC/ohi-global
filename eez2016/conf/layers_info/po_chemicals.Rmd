Melanie will do this one.

See description for chemical pollution layer [po_chemicals].

First, we produced annual values for land-based nutrient and organic pollution (a component of the ‘chemical’ pollution variable used in the model, which also incorporates land-based inorganic and ocean-based), such that each year of assessment has a unique value and the trend in these values is now directly measured from these annual changes rather than from a proxy measure (as was done previously, using FAO fertilizer and pesticide data). 

). Third, we clipped pollution plume data to the 3nm offshore boundary, as was originally done (Halpern et al. 2012) but incorrectly not subsequently (Halpern et al. 2015).

Once plumed data were produced, values were log(X+1)-transformed and rescaled to the 99.99th quantile across all available years.

This includes pesticides (land-based organics), shipping, harbors, land-based inorganic

Trend in pesticide consumption comes
from the FAO Statistical Yearbook 201182. These data
span 1999-2009 and have country spatial resolution.
We obtained total pesticide consumption data (in
metric tons of active ingredients) from FAO 82 which
uses survey methods to measure quantities of
pesticides applied to crops and seeds in the
agriculture sector, and includes insecticides, mineral
oils, herbicides, fungicides, seed treatments
insecticides, seed treatments fungicides, plant growth
regulators and rodenticides. For each OHI region we
report the metric tons of active ingredients per km2,
calculate a linear regression per region over the 1999-
2009 timeframe, and then compute the Trend value
for each region.

Additional information from S1_PloS_OHI2015:
To allow for more direct comparison between assessments from 2012 (input data from 2003-2006, as was done previously) and 2013 (input data from 2007-2010, the most recent available), we recalculated this layer using updated data but the same methods as before. In particular, we used FAO data on annual country-level pesticide use, averaged over the time periods, with missing values filled in by regression between fertilizer (see nutrient pollution, below) and pesticides when possible, and when not possible with agricultural GDP as proxy (see Halpern et al. 2008 for methods). These country-level values were then dasymetrically distributed over a country’s landscape using global land cover data from the years 2005 (for the 2003-2006 time period) and 2009 (for the 2007-2010 time period), derived from the MODIS satellite at ~500m resolution (following methods described in Halpern et al. 2008 but with updated MODIS data not available previously). These values were then aggregated by ~140,000 global basins (developed for and presented in Halpern et al. 2008), and diffusive plumes were modeled from each basin’s pourpoint. The final non-zero plumes (about ~76,000) were aggregated into ~1km Mollweide (wgs84) projection rasters to produce a single plume-aggregated pollution raster. These raw values were then log(x+1) transformed and normalized to 0-1. A simple visual and pixel-count comparison of the agriculture land cover classes shows that, globally, these classes have not changed much during the two time periods (at the 500m resolution of the data). However, global pesticide consumption has shown a small, but significant increase globally (roughly 4-8% over our time period).
