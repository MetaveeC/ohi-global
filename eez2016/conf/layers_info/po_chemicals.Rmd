Melanie will do this one.

Trend in pesticide consumption comes
from the FAO Statistical Yearbook 201182. These data
span 1999-2009 and have country spatial resolution.
We obtained total pesticide consumption data (in
metric tons of active ingredients) from FAO 82 which
uses survey methods to measure quantities of
pesticides applied to crops and seeds in the
agriculture sector, and includes insecticides, mineral
oils, herbicides, fungicides, seed treatments
insecticides, seed treatments fungicides, plant growth
regulators and rodenticides. For each OHI region we
report the metric tons of active ingredients per km2,
calculate a linear regression per region over the 1999-
2009 timeframe, and then compute the Trend value
for each region.
