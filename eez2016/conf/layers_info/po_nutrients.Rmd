Melanie will do this one.

See description for nutrient pollution layer [po_nutrients].

Raw data were drawn from modeled
plumes of land-based nitrogen pollution, as developed
by Halpern et al. 3, that provided intensity of pollution
at 1km2 resolution. The model distributed countrylevel
fertilizer use onto land-use classes (via
dasymetric mapping techniques) and then aggregated
the spatialized data by watersheds as a proxy measure
for likely amount of this pollution that reached river
mouths. Plumes were then distributed using a
diffusive model. Each ocean pixel was then rescaled
0-1 based on the global maximum pixel value (see ref
3 for details).These rescaled raw data were used in
two ways. For the Clean Waters goal and for coastal
Pressure, which focused on the first 3 nmi of ocean
adjacent to land, the layer was clipped to 3 nmi
offshore, weighted by habitat-type, and then the perpixel
average calculated for each reporting unit
(EEZ). This zonal mean gives an average intensity
score that accounts for the large differences in area
per reporting unit, but is also weighted by habitat type
using weighting factors in Halpern et al.3. We
therefore rescaled the zonal mean by dividing by
maximum value (7.58). For a Status score, we used 1
minus the pressures score. For EEZ Pressure, we
calculated the zonal mean of the rescaled raw data for
each EEZ.
