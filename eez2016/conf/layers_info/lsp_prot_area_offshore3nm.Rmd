See status/trend calculations for lasting special places goal for a description of these data.  This includes marine protected areas within 3nm offshore of the coastline.

Several changes were made to how the protected areas data were used to calculate this score. First, we extracted spatial data from WDPA at 500m2 raster resolution rather than the 1km2 resolution used previously – this had important effects on measures of size and location of protected areas, especially smaller ones.  

Data on protected areas through January 2015 were accessed from the United Nations Environment Programme - World Conservation Monitoring Centre’s World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) through http://www.protectedplanet.net. We used only WDPA polygons (not points) with a status of “designated” (not “proposed”). These polygons were converted to a 500 m Mollweide raster by the value of the year in which the park was decreed “designated”. For cases in which polygons overlapped, priority was given first to the parks with the earliest year. Spatial subsets used within the Lasting Special Places (LSP) sub-goal include the offshore 3 nm and inland 1km. 


2012 description:
The World Database on Protected Areas
59 comes from the United Nations Environment
Programme-World Conservation Monitoring Centre
(UNEP-WCMC) and includes all nationally
designated (e.g. National Parks, Nature Reserves) and
internationally recognized protected areas (e.g.
UNESCO World Heritage Sites, Ramsar Wetlands of
International Importance) globally in ESRI shapefile
formats. All protected areas within the database meet
IUCNs definition of a protected area. The protected
areas range in official standing (e.g. proposed,
designated); we only included protected areas in the
dataset that had designated status. We extracted
vector data for 98,358 designated protected areas
from the WDPA database (using STATUS=
"Designated"), and projected them into Mollweide.
Each record for a designated protected area includes
the year in which the protected area was designated
(STATUS_YR), ranging from 1872-2009 and NoData
(0). We also extracted an extra 8,965 designated
protected areas by downloading vector data from the
WDPA website for select countries who were not
included in the WDPA (2010) database (for various
reasons), and then we excluded areas without explicit
spatial area data (IS_POINT=1): Dominican Republic
(no designated areas), Gambia (2 designated areas),
Guinea (106 designated areas), Singapore (7
designated areas), United Kingdom (8,849 designated
areas), and Uruguay (1 designated area).
We rasterized all the WDPA designated areas
using 1km resolution and the year designated as the
cell value, resolving conflicts using the oldest year as
a priority field and excluding NoData. As described in
Table S16, for status we calculated areas within 3 nmi
offshore and within 1 km inland; for the coastal
version of resilience, we calculated the total area
within 3 nmi offshore; and for the EEZ version, any
offshore areas within the region were included. For the resilience, we used a reference point of 30%
protection of the coastal area, where any region with
more than 30% of its coastal area having protected
areas were set to resilience=1. A total of 45 countries
did not have spatially-explicit nearshore marine or
coastal protected areas listed in the 2010 WDPA
database. For six of these countries we were able to
use the 2011 WDPA database to get protected area
information. Nine of these countries likely truly do
not have any nearshore marine or coastal protected
area and three countries were not included in the
dataset and also given a score of zero. The remaining
27 have some amount but there is no spatial
information provided in the database and so we could
not resolve if the areas fell within the nearshore
marine or coastal regions (as we define these areas)
and so were given no credit for coastal protected
areas.

More notes from: S1_PLoS_OHI2015:
Data on protected areas through August, 2013 were accessed from the United Nations Environment Programme - World Conservation Monitoring Centre’s World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) through http://www.protectedplanet.net. We used only WDPA polygons (not points) with a status of “designated” (not “proposed”). These polygons were converted to a 1km Mollweide raster by the value of the year in which the park was decreed “designated”. For cases in which polygons overlapped, priority was given first to the parks with a designation type of national (over international) and then the earliest year. In the future, we hope to apply buffers to parks spatially assigned as points based on area with extra logic to portion out the parks based on percentage marine vs terrestrial and limited to within country borders where applicable (Visconti et al. 2013). Spatial subsets used within the Lasting Special Places (LSP) sub-goal include the offshore 3 nm and inland 1km. The most recent full year was used for LSP status to be inclusive as possible, but presume a 3-year lag in exhaustive reporting to better estimate a trend.
