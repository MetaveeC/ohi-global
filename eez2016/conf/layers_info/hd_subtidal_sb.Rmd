Spatially distributed half-degree global commercial catch data developed by Sea Around Us Project, based on FAO and other source data, were assigned to fishing gear types using global taxon-gear associations. These data were used to calculate catch (tonnes per year) from trawling for each year. Trawling gears were defined as dredges, hand dredges, bottom trawls, and shrimp trawls (mid-water trawls were excluded). These
catches were assumed to be uniform within each halfdegree cell. ‘Trawlable habitat’ within an EEZ was defined as shallow subtidal (0-60m) and outer shelf (60-200m) soft bottom habitat. The total trawled catch within each EEZ was then divided by the total area of soft-bottom habitat to produce a measure of trawl intensity per unit area. Because these data were extremely skewed, we log(X+1) transformed them and then rescaled to the maximum value from all year-country possibilities. Status was then calculated as one minus the rescaled catch density in the most recent year. This status value was then rescaled to the median intensity density
value across all years, i.e. any value greater than the median was set = 1.0. The Pressure score was then one minus this median-rescaled value; the inverse of this rescaled value was used for the Habitat sub-goal of the Biodiversity goal.
