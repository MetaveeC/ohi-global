From S1_PLoS_OHI2015:

Methods for this pressure layer were identical to those described for commercial fishing: high bycatch, except the two low bycatch commercial fishing categories were used (demersal low bycatch, e.g., hook and line; and pelagic low bycatch, e.g., purse seines) and averaged to create the single low bycatch pressure layer.

From OHI2105_methods_update_final:
Methods for this pressure layer were identical to those described above (6.11) for commercial fishing: high bycatch, except the two low bycatch commercial fishing categories were used (demersal low bycatch, e.g., hook and line; and pelagic low bycatch, e.g., purse seines) and averaged to create the single low bycatch pressure layer.
