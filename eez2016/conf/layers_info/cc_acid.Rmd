Old supplement:
This Pressure layer models the
difference in global distribution of the aragonite
saturation state (AAS) of the ocean in pre-industrial
(~1870) and modern times (2000-2009). These data
are modeled at 1-degree resolution. 
Changes in the AAS can be attributed to changes in the concentration
of CO2 and thus we use the difference between the
pre-industrial and modern times as a proxy for ocean
acidification due to human influences. Full details on
this data layer are provided in Halpern et al.3.
