This layer uses fish catch reconstruction data from the [Sea Around Us Project](http://www.seaaroundus.org/) (SAUP) to estimate the status of global fish stocks. Spatially explicity catch data (tons per cell) is provided at 0.5 degree resolution. A stock is defined by the FAO region in which the species is caught. The catch-MSY model (Martell & Froese 2012) is applied to each stock to estimate B/Bmsy, the ratio of population biomass compared to the biomass required to deliver maximum sustainable yield, for all stocks reported at the species level. All stocks that have been assessed through a formal stock assessment are assigned the status as it exists within the [RAM Legacy Database](http://ramlegacy.org/) rather than the estimated B/Bmsy.

For more details on how B/Bmsy estimates are integrated into the Food Provision goal, see the Fisheries sub-goal description.
