Add in RAM stuff
cut stock resilience stuff

For this current assessment we replaced this approach with estimates of B/BMSY, the ratio of population abundance compared to the abundance required to deliver maximum sustainable yield, obtained from the catch-MSY model (Martell and Froese, in press, see the Fisheries sub-goal description for Food Provision for more details). Although both approaches use similar empirically-derived relationships on depletion levels, the current model uses more information contained in the annual catch data and produces estimates that take into account how species with different life-history traits have different levels of resilience to fishing exploitation. An important difference from the previous approach is that the output is an index on a continuous scale, and management frameworks differ in how they define what range of B/BMSY constitutes an “overfished” status, or a “depleted” status, etc. For details on how the values are converted to a score on a scale from 0 to 1, see proportion of the Fisheries sub-goal description for Food Provision. Previously stock status was only used as a sustainability coefficient for Fish Oil in the Natural Products goal; it is now an integral part of how the Fisheries sub-goal in Food Provision goal is calculated.
