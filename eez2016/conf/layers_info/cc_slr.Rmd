Jamie working on this one

2012 supplement:
This stressor measures the number of
positive temperature anomalies that exceed the
natural range of variation for a given location, i.e. the
degree to which a location experiences unnaturally
warm temperature. It is not a measure of absolute
temperature at a location. The idea behind using this
measure of SST change is that species are adapted to
their natural range of temperatures and this metric
provides a globally consistent measure of events
beyond that normal range to use as a basis for SST
impacts. Full details on this data layer are provided in
Halpern et al.3.
