The UN geopolitical region classification of OHI regions (United Nations Statistics Division, 2016; http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm). These data are often used for gapfilling missing data.  Level r0 is the most general classification, and all OHI regions have the same classification (World), r1 is more specific, and there are seven geopolitical classes (Africa, Americas, etc.), and r2 is the most specific with 22 geopolitical classes (Caribbean, Central America, etc.).
