This parameter is estimated by the per capita purchasing power parity (PPP) adjusted gross domestic product (GDP), i.e. GDPpcPPP, as described previously (Halpern et al. 2012; the model treats need as 1- GDPpcPPP). Index Mundi (www.indexmundi.com describes GDP and PPP as:
“GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year. A nation's GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates is the sum value of all goods and services produced in the country valued at prices prevailing in the United States in the year noted. This is the measure most economists prefer when looking at per-capita welfare and when comparing living conditions or use of resources across countries. The measure is difficult to compute, as a US dollar value has to be assigned to all goods and services in the country regardless of whether these goods and services have a direct equivalent in the United States (for example, the value of an ox-cart or non-US military equipment); as a result, PPP estimates for some countries are based on a small and sometimes different set of goods and services. In addition, many countries do not formally participate in the World Bank's PPP project that calculates these measures, so the resulting GDP estimates for these countries may lack precision. For many developing countries, PPP-based GDP measures are multiples of the official exchange rate (OER) measure. The differences between the OER- and PPP-denominated GDP values for most of the wealthy industrialized countries are generally much smaller.”
Updated GDPpcPPP calculations were available through 2012 from the World Bank (http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD) and are reported in 2012 US dollars for all years. For the three EEZs that fall within the China region (China, Macau, and Hong Kong), we combined the values using a population-weighted sum.
