Jamie working on this one

2012 supplement:
This pressure measures the number of
times between 2000 and 2004, in each 1 degree cell,
that the monthly average exceeded the climatological
mean + 1 standard deviation within the entire dataset
(1996-2004). These values were summed across the
12 months to provide a single value, ranging from 0-
19. We did not use the metric of change in these
anomalous values from the early period to the current
period, as was done for SST data, since the entire UV
dataset covers only 9 years. See Halpern et al.3 for
full details on this dataset.
