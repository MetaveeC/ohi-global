National GDP data were obtained from the World Bank (http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ NY.GDP.MKTP.CD) and converted into 2010 USD from current USD.  These data were used in livelihood and economy goals to adjust revenue data. For the three EEZs that fall within the China region (China, Macau, and Hong Kong), we combined the values using a population-weighted average.
