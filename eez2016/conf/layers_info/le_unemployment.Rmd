Supplement 2012 7.48

From S1_PLoS_OHI2015:

Updated unemployment data through 2012 were available from the World Bank (http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.UEM.TOTL.ZS). These data are reported as the percent of the total labor force that is available to work and seeking employment but is without work. Because other data layers used for the tourism and recreation goal ended in 2011, we used 2011 values for current status calculations. Gap-filling procedures (see section 6 below) were required for >100 regions per year; in 5-20 cases this produced negative values and in 8-10 cases gap-filling procedures did not have sufficient data to produce a value. For each of these cases we set unemployment to the average per-year value from the regions with reported values (2011 = 8.78%, 2010 = 8.96%, 2009 = 9.34%, 2008 = 8.9%, 2007 = 8.3%, and 2006 8.7%). For the three EEZs that fall within the China region (China, Macau, and Hong Kong), we combined the values using a population-weighted average.
