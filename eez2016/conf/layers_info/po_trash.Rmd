A new dataset showing the global distribution of marine plastics at 0.2 degree resolution was used (Erikson et al. 2014). Two types of data were provided, count and weight of plastics in 4 different size classes. For this layer, we summed the weight across all four size classes, apply a log transformation and rescaling from 0 to 1 using the 99.99th quantile as the reference point.
