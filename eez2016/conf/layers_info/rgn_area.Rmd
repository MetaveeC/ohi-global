Area (km2) for each region's EEZ-based boundary. 

OHI offshore regions are based on exclusive economic zones (EEZ, VLIZ 2012). All unique EEZs were used to define a region, except for the following groupings: Trindade into Brazil, Easter Island into Chile, Galapagos Islands into Ecuador, and Alaska and Hawaii into USA. Splitting has since occurred for Antilles (Sint-Maarten, Cura√ßao, Bonaire, Saba, Sint-Eustasius, Aruba), and Malaysia has been reapportioned to accommodate the new EEZ of Brunei. Many borders have been redrawn, such as the removal of UK claims around Cyprus. Gaps and extensions between this EEZ file and our land-sea mask were resolved through GIS operations (buffer, erase, and polygon neighbor analysis). Ocean area per region was calculated using geodesic area calculations on the region polygons in geographic coordinates. We exclude from regions the inland EEZs of the Caspian Sea and any disputed areas.
