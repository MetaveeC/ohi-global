Section 7.10 and 7.64 (probably should be merged) from 2012 supplement

And here is the info. from S1_PLoS_OHI2015:

Offshore areas information:
The same land-sea mask was used as last year. Regions this year are more spatially refined and based on a newer version (v7) of exclusive economic zones (VLIZ 2012). All unique exclusive economic zones (EEZ) were used to define a region, except for the following groupings: Trindade into Brazil, Easter Island into Chile, Galapagos Islands into Ecuador, and Alaska and Hawaii into USA. Splitting has since occurred for Antilles (Sint-Maarten, Cura√ßao, Bonaire, Saba, Sint-Eustasius, Aruba), and Malaysia has been reapportioned to accommodate the new EEZ of Brunei. Many borders have been redrawn, such as the removal of UK claims around Cyprus. Gaps and extensions between this EEZ file and our land-sea mask were resolved through GIS operations (buffer, erase, and polygon neighbor analysis). Ocean area per region was calculated using geodesic area calculations on the region polygons in geographic coordinates. We exclude from regions the inland EEZs of the Caspian Sea and any disputed areas.

Country land areas information:
This value represents the total land area (not including inland lakes or EEZs) within each country. Updated land area data for 2012 were extracted from ESRI (www.esri.com) and any gaps were filled using data for 2012 downloaded from the CIA World Factbook (CIA 2013).
