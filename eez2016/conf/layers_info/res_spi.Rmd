The Social Progress Index (http://www.socialprogressimperative.org/global-index/) includes several quality of life measures.  The SPI score is calculated by averaging the score of 3 dimensions, and each dimension is calculated by averageing the scores of 4 components.  Each component includes several indicators that are scaled from 0 to 100.  The SPI is not calculated for any region with 1 or more missing subcomonents.  In these cases, we used a linear regression model of the subcomponets with data to estimate the subcomponents with missing values.  Regions without data were gapfilled using a linear regression model that included UN geopolitical region and WGI values as predictor variables.  Uninhabited regions received no score.
