Data for total labor force (number of people) was obtained from 1980-2012 from World Bank assessments (data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.TOTL.IN). The World Bank defines total labor force based on the International Labour Organisation (ILO)’s definition of an economically active population – those 15 years old and older who can supply labor for the production of goods and services – and includes those employed and unemployed, as well as those in the armed forces, and generally excludes homemakers and other unpaid caregivers and workers in the informal sector. For the three EEZs that fall within the China region (China, Macau, and Hong Kong), we combined the values by summing.
