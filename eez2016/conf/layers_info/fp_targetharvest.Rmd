This data layer compiles data from FAO
82 on catch of cetaceans and marine turtles. We
searched and extracted all catch titles that could
include cetaceans or marine turtles and aggregated to
create a total reported catch count for cetaceans and
tonnes caught for marine turtles for each country.
Reported catch for 2009 was used for most countries
unless data were unavailable for 2009 and there was a
reported catch for 2008. In those cases, 2008 data
were used. For both cetaceans and marine turtles the
summed catch was rescaled from 0-1, with 1 = 110%
the maximum value across all countries. The two
scores were then averaged to create a single “targeted
harvest” score.
