See description for chemical pollution layer [po_chemicals].

The inverse of the pressure data (1 - value) from the po_chemicals layer (including only the 3nm offshore region) was used to estimate chemical trends for the clean water goal. The proportional yearly change in chemical pressure values were estimated using a linear regression model of the most recent five years of data (i.e., slope divided by data from the earliest year included in the regression model).  The slope was then multiplied by five to get the predicted change in 5 years.  

The only layer with yearly data was the land-based organic pollution (pesticide data). The land-based inorganic pollution (using impermeable surfaces as a proxy) and ocean pollution (shipping and ports) remained the same.
