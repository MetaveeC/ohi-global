From OHI2105_methods_update_final:
For this layer, we used updated Sea Around Us Project (SAUP) catch reconstruction data and new net primary productivity data.  The new SAUP data were available only at the country scale and did not differentiate catch by gear type.  To estimate high resolution catch data by gear type we used the original global (0.5 degree resolution) catch by gear spatial data provided by the SAUP for Halpern et al. (2008) to calculate the proportion of catch caught by high and low bycatch gears within each raster cell. The updated global catch from the Sea Around Us Project for the years 2006-2010 was summarized per EEZ and FAO region and then distributed across the respective region based on the proportion catch with each raster cell for high and low bycatch gear. This method assumes that proportion of catch per gear type has remained constant within a region, although absolute catch can change. The layer was then standardized by average net primary production (VGPM) over the same years, 2006 to 2010. Updating the NPP data had not been done previously. Data was log transformed and then normalized by using the 99.99th quantile.

Description from S1_PLoS_OHI2015:

The most recent spatially-explicit global estimates of catch by gear type were developed and used in Halpern et al. (2008), where catch was allocated to 5 different gear types at half-degree resolution, and have not been updated since. To estimate changes in this pressure, we used the spatially-allocated catch data (see 5.68 below) and calculated the percent change in total annual catch per reporting region as the difference between the most recent reporting period (2009 to 2011) and the period (1999 to 2003) previously used by Halpern et al. (2008), divided by the original period (1999 to 2003). Each of the three high-bycatch 1km raster layers (Halpern et al. 2008) was then multiplied by the percent change specific to each Sea Around Us reporting region to create estimates of current spatially-explicit catch by gear type. Although this calculation requires the unlikely assumption that the proportional amount of catch per Sea Around Us reporting region has remained the same over the past 10 years, we felt it better to make this assumption than to assume fishing pressure has not changed at all.
Overall pressure per gear class per Index reporting region was then calculated as the mean of all 1km pixel values within the region for each of the two time periods. The maximum possible score (which is used to rescale all values 0-1) was then determined as 110% of the maximum regional score across either time period, such that all regions were rescaled to the same value. For each pressure layer the maximum came from the previous time period (1999-2003; Halpern et al. 2008; Halpern et al. 2012). As was done previously (Halpern et al. 2012), high bycatch commercial fishing was then measured as the average of demersal destructive (e.g., trawl), demersal non-destructive high bycatch (e.g., pots, traps) and pelagic high bycatch (e.g., long-line) gear.
