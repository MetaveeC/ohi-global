These data describe the current effectiveness of fisheries management regimes along 6 axes (Melnychuk et al. 2017): scientific robustness, policy transparency, implementation capacity, subsidies, fishing effort, and foreign fishing. All countries with coastal areas were assessed through a combination of surveys, empirical data and enquiries to fisheries experts. For each OHI reporting region, scores for each category were rescaled between 0 and 1 using the maximum possible value for each category and then the average score of all 6 categories was used as the overall fisheries management effectiveness score.

Data are not accessible in csv format from website, so points were manually entered into excel and saved as a csv. Because FMI scores only exist for 40 out of the 220 OHI regions, we predicted missing values using a linear models with Social Progress Index and UN georegion data as predictors. Uninhabited regions (N=20) were given an NA value.
