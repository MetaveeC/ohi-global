Fisheries catch data describe the average catch across years (from 1980 to present) for each fish stock and region. These values were used to weight stock status scores (derived from B/Bmsy values) in the fisheries model. The Global Fisheries Landings data (Watson 2019) is reported at 0.5 degree resolution for taxonomic levels range from species to class to "Miscellaneous not identified" for each year. Tonnes of catch for each taxon and year were summed within each OHI region, and then the average catch across years (1980 to present) was determined for each taxon and region.
