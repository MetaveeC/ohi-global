Travel advisories are from the U.S. State Department ([https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings.html](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings.html)).  Penalty scores were based on the urgency of warning (‘Exercise Normal Precautions’= 1 (no penalty), ‘Exercise Increase Caution’= 1 (no penalty), ‘Reconsider Travel’=0.25, and ‘Do Not Travel’ = 0).
