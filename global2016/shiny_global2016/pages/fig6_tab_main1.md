#### Relationship between change in OHI score and rank

<font size = 2>
The change in each countryâ€™s OHI score and rank was calculated from 2012 to 2016. Dark red line is the linear regression slope estimate. 

Changes in scores were strongly correlated with changes in rank order, with greater deviation from predicted shifts with more positive or negative changes. However, many regions had large shifts in either score or rank but not the other (mouse over points far above or below the linear regression line). The fact that the same change in score can result in very different changes in rank is in part due to the underlying distribution of scores not being uniform and highlights how rank order is not an ideal indicator of ocean health and can be misleading..
