#### Relationship between change in OHI score and rank

<font size = 2>
The change in each countryâ€™s OHI score and rank was calculated from 2012 to 2016. The dark red line is the linear regression slope estimate. 

A comparison of the Republique du Congo and Gilbert Islands (Kiribati) illustrates how roughly the same change in score (-7.52 vs. -7.89, respectively) can result in a very different change in rank (-12 vs. -78); note also cases where the same change in rank can result from very different changes in scores. In some cases countries had a decrease in score but an increase in rank (N=12), or alternatively, an increase in score and decrease in rank (N=4).

This plot corresponds to Fig 6 from the published paper and Figs I and J from the SI.
