#### Relationship between change in OHI score and rank

<font size = 2>
Each dot on this plot refers to a coastal country. Where the dot falls on the plot indicates the change in that countryâ€™s OHI score and rank among all of the countries from 2012 to 2016. The dark red line shows the estimated average relationship between score change and rank change, based on a linear regression model. 

In some cases, countries with roughly the same change in score, such as the Republique du Congo and Gilbert Islands (Kiribati) (-7.52 vs. -7.89, respectively), can have very different changes in rank (-12 vs. -78).  In other cases, countries may have similar change in rank but very different changes in scores (e.g. Republique du Congo vs. Saint Kitts and Nevis).  This is because scores are not uniformly distributed (see distributions on the "Score maps" tab); change in score within a tight cluster of scores will result in larger changes in rank than a similar change outside of such a cluster.  This suggests that absolute values for goal scores are a more useful indicator of condition than rank order, especially when tracking change over time.

This plot corresponds to Fig 6 from the published paper and Figs I and J from the SI.
