Score 2012 - 2016: Scores for the overall Index and each of the OHI goals and subgoals displayed for each region, for 2012 to 2016. The Index figure (map + histogram) corresponds to Figure 1A/B in the published paper, while the per-goal figures correspond to Figures B and C in the supporting information.
