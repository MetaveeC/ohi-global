__C)__ Expected change in status (OHI status minus ‘likely future status’ from 2012 scenario) and the observed change (status in 2016 minus status in 2012). 

To directly address the ability of ‘likely future state’ to predict realized future ‘current status’, we compared predicted changes to observed changes and found a non-significant, weak relationship for the combined Index.
