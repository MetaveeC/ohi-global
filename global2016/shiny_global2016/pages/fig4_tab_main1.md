#### Drivers of change in OHI scores from 2012-2016

<font size = 2>
Contribution of OHI goals to changes in annual Index scores (use the interface to the left to view different groupings of regions).

Improvements in **natural products**, **sense of place**, and **tourism & recreation** drove overall improvement in the regions with the highest increase in overall Index score, while declines in **natural products** and, to a lesser degree, **tourism & recreation** were the primary drivers of the greatest declines in regions. Minor changes in region-level Index scores were the result of a wide range of possible combinations of changes in goal scores. For example, a minimal change in all goals or large changes (but in opposite directions) of two or more goals could both lead to only a minor change in a regionâ€™s overall score.
