#### Drivers of change in OHI scores from 2012-2016

<font size = 2>
Changes to countries’ individual goal scores varied and influenced their overall Index score. This plot shows how score changes for each goal contributed to the overall Index change for every coastal country. When countries are filtered by “High-mid-low,” the plot includes the 15 regions with largest increases and decreases in scores and 10 representative regions in between (denoted by grey background). 

The size of the colored bars represents the magnitude of change for that goal.  If the colored area is to the right of the zero line, it had a positive impact on the score; if the bar is to the left, it had a negative impact.  It is important to note that minor change in an Index score can occur due to a wide range of possible combinations of changes in goal scores.

This plot corresponds to Fig 4 from the published paper and Fig G from the supporting information.
