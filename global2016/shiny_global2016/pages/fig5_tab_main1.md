#### Evaluating the OHI model using 5 years of data. 

<font size = 2>
Relationship between different aspects of OHI scores. Select "Index" to the left to evaluate the overall index score (corresponding to Fig 5 in the published paper), or individual goals to evaluate predicted changes vs. observed changes within each goal (corresponding to Fig H from the SI).

(Top) OHI scores in 2012 versus 2016, showing past scores predict future scores; (Middle) ‘likely future status’ in 2012 (i.e., predicted status in 2016) versus observed status in 2016, with black line indicating the slope estimate from a linear regression model; and (Bottom) expected change in status (OHI status minus ‘likely future status’ from 2012 scenario) and the observed change (status in 2016 minus status in 2012). Red lines indicate the one-to-one relationship.
