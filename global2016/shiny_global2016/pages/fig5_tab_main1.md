#### Evaluating the OHI model using 5 years of data. 

<font size = 2>
The Ocean Health Index score for a given goal includes the current status and a prediction of "likely future status," based on recent trends, pressures, and resilience.  These figures compare the performance of the OHI model in tracking and predicting changes in status and likely future status. Select "Index" to the left to evaluate the overall index score (corresponding to Fig 5 in the published paper), or individual goals to evaluate predicted changes vs. observed changes within each goal (corresponding to Fig H from the SI).  Lighter red lines indicate a one-to-one relationship, while dark red lines indicate the estimate from a linear regression model.

* Top: OHI scores in 2012 versus 2016; clustering around the 1:1 line and high R^2^ values show that past scores are a strong predictor future scores.
* Middle: "Likely future status" in 2012 (i.e., a prediction of status for 2016) versus observed status in 2016. High R^2^ values show that predictions of future status (i.e. "likely future status" from 2012) correlate strongly with observed future status (i.e. current status 2016).
* Bottom: expected change in status (OHI "likely future status" from 2012 scenario minus current status from 2012) and the observed change (status in 2016 minus status in 2012). It appears the predicted changes bear little relation to observed changes, with observed changes generally being quite small relative to predicted changes.
