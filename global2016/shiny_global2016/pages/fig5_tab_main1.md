#### Evaluating the OHI model using 5 years of data. 

<font size = 2>
Relationship between different aspects of OHI scores. Select "Index" to the left to evaluate the overall index score (corresponding to Fig 5 in the published paper), or individual goals to evaluate predicted changes vs. observed changes within each goal (corresponding to Fig H from the SI).

A) OHI scores in 2012 versus 2016, showing past scores predict future scores. Light red lines indicate the one-to-one relationship, while dark red lines indicate the linear regression line.

Overall, there was a strong, highly significant relationship between overall scores in 2012 and 2016 (figure A). The few exceptions (mouse over points to identify individual countries, or filter by georegion using the controls to the left) resulted from very large changes in a few goals (see "Trend bars" tab).
