#### Global average yearly change in goal scores from 2012-2016

<font size = 2>
Average annual change in global status for each goal and subgoal, unweighted (blue dots) and weighted by size of EEZ (orange dots). Solid circles indicate trends significantly different from zero; open circles are non-significant. 

Large differences between unweighted and weighted values (e.g. natural products and fisheries) result from countries with large EEZs having scores significantly different from the global average.

This plot corresponds to Fig 2 in the published paper.
