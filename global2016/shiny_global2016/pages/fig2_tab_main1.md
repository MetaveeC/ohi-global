#### Global average yearly change in goal scores from 2012-2016

<font size = 2>
Average annual change in global status for each goal and subgoal, unweighted (blue dots) and weighted by size of EEZ (orange dots). Solid circles indicate trends significantly different from zero; open circles are non-significant. 

Within a country, changes in goal scores could be fairly dramatic (select the "Show individual countries" on the left to observe these data); however, there were relatively small absolute changes at the global scale. The largest increase was for the lasting special places subgoal goal (nearly +1 point increase per year, unweighted) and the largest decrease was for the natural products goal (nearly -4 point decrease per year, unweighted). Natural products, coastal protection, and carbon storage all saw steady declines over the five years; lasting special places, fisheries, artisanal fishing opportunities and species biodiversity all saw steady increases. Within regions, the changes in goal scores could be dramatic.
