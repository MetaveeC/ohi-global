#### Relationship between score and annual change in score

<font size = 2>
OHI scores for 2016 versus the annual change in score over 5 years for each region. Red dashed lines indicate no change over time (horizontal line) and the mean Index score across regions (vertical line); dark red line is the linear regression slope. 

In general, regions with higher Index scores in 2016 tended to have improved over time (i.e., the good get better) and regions with lower scores tended to have worsened (p<0.001, linear regression model of change per year ~ Index score), although there were plenty of exceptions.  Use the interface to the left to focus on geographic regional groupings, or mouse over individual data points to observe changes for particular countries.
