#### Relationship between score and annual change in score

<font size = 2>
OHI scores for 2016 versus the annual change in score over 5 years for each region. Red dashed lines indicate no change over time (horizontal line) and the mean Index score across regions (vertical line); dark red line is the linear regression slope. 

Regions with higher Index scores in 2016 that improved through time are in the top-right quadrant, and countries with lower scores that declined through time are in the bottom-left.  There were significant differences among georegions (P < 0.001), which can be explored by viewing different georegions.

This plot corresponds to Fig 3 from the published paper.
