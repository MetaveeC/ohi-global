#### Relationship between score and annual change in score

<font size = 2>
This figure shows OHI scores for 2016 versus the trend over the past 5 years for each region. Each dot represents one OHI region, comparing its score in 2016 to its overall trend.  Red dashed lines indicate no change over time (horizontal line) and the mean Index score across regions (vertical line); the dark red line is the linear regression slope. 

Regions with higher Index scores in 2016 that improved through time are in the top-right quadrant, and countries with lower scores that declined through time are in the bottom-left.  Choose a georegion to view the significant differences in scores and trends within and among georegions (P < 0.001).

This plot corresponds to Fig 3 from the published paper.
