<p>This layer represents the opportunity for artisanal and recreational fishing in each country based on the quality of management of the small-scale fishing sector. Global data were extracted from Mora et al. (2009), Figure S4. Figure S4 is based on two expert opinion survey questions related to artisanal and recreational fishing (classified as small-scale fishing; presented in Table S5). Overall scores for small-scale fisheries management for each country are based on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores representing better management. These values were then rescaled (using a maximum value of 100 and minimum value of 0) to range between 0 and 1 for each OHI region.</p>
<p>Questions from Mora et al. that were used to evaluate access to artisanal scale fishing:</p>
<p>If recreational fishing exists to any extent, which of the following apply?</p>
<ul>
<li>Are recreational fishermen required to have a fishing license? Y/N</li>
<li>Are there regulations to the size of fish caught? Y/N</li>
<li>Are there regulations to the number of fish caught? Y/N</li>
<li>Are there regulations to the number of fishermen allowed to fish? Y/N</li>
<li>Are there statistics being collected for this sort of fishing? Y/N</li>

<p>Status of global fish stocks based on B/Bmsy values (the ratio of population biomass compared to the biomass required to deliver maximum sustainable yield). We preferentially used B/Bmsy estimates from formal stock assessments from the<br />
RAM Legacy Database <a href="http://ramlegacy.org/" class="uri">http://ramlegacy.org/</a>. We assigned the stocks to OHI and FAO regions using Free (2017) spatial data describing the range of each stock. When a stock was missing the most recent years of data, we used linear models of the previous years of data to estimate the missing years.</p>
<p>When RAM data were unavailable, we use the data-limited catch-MSY model (Martell &amp; Frowese 2012) to estimate B/Bmsy values using yearly fish catch reconstruction data from the <a href="http://www.seaaroundus.org/">Sea Around Us Project</a> (SAUP, Zeller and Pauly 2007). SAUP provides catch data (tons per cell) for individual taxa (identified from the species level to “Miscellaneous not identified”) at 0.5 degree resolution. For the catch-MSY model, we defined a stock as a species caught within an FAO major fishing area (www.fao.org/fishery/area/search/en), which eliminates all the taxa not identified to species level. This approach assumes that stocks are defined by FAO region, which we know is often not true because multiple stocks of the same species can exist within an FAO region and some stocks cover multiple FAO regions. However, this assumption is necessary without range maps of stocks. The catch data were summed for each species/FAO region/year, and the catch-MSY model was applied to each stock to estimate B/Bmsy.</p>

<p><em>Pressure</em></p>
<p><em>Category: ecological</em></p>
<p><em>Subcategory: pollution</em></p>
<p>This pressure layer is calculated using modeled data for land-based organic pollution (pesticide data), land-based inorganic pollution (using impermeable surfaces as a proxy), and ocean pollution (shipping and ports). These global data are provided at ~1km resolution, with raster values scaled from 0-1 (Halpern et al. 2008, 2015). To obtain the final pressure values, the three raster layers were summed (with cell values capped at 1).</p>
</div>
<div id="land-based-organic-pollution" class="section level4">
<h4>Land-based organic pollution</h4>
<p>Data were calculated using modeled plumes of land-based pesticide pollution that provide intensity of pollution at 1km<sup>2</sup> resolution (Halpern et al. 2008).</p>
<p>Organic pollution was estimated from FAO data on annual country-level pesticide use (<a href="http://faostat3.fao.org/faostat-gateway/go/to/browse/R/*/E" class="uri">http://faostat3.fao.org/faostat-gateway/go/to/browse/R/*/E</a>), measured in metric tons of active ingredients. FAO uses survey methods to measure quantities of pesticides applied to crops and seeds in the agriculture sector, including insecticides, mineral oils, herbicides, fungicides, seed treatments insecticides, seed treatments fungicides, plant growth regulators and rodenticides. Missing values were estimated by regression between fertilizer and pesticides when possible, and when not possible with agricultural GDP as a proxy. Data were summed across all pesticide compounds and reported in metric tons. Upon inspection the data included multiple 0 values that are most likely data gaps in the time-series, so they were treated as such and replaced with NA. In addition, regions with only 1 data point and regions where the most recent data point was prior to 2005 were excluded. Uninhabited countries were assumed to have no pesticide use and thus excluded.</p>
<p>Region-level pollution values were then dasymetrically distributed over a region’s landscape using global landcover data from 2009, derived from the MODIS satellite data at ~500m resolution. These values were then aggregated by ~140,000 global basins, and diffusive plumes were modeled from each basin’s pourpoint. The final non-zero plumes (about ~76,000) were aggregated into ~1km Mollweide (wgs84) projection rasters to produce a single plume-aggregated pollution raster.</p>
<p>These raw values were then ln(X+1) transformed and normalized to 0-1 by dividing by the 99.99th quantile of raster values across all years. The zonal mean was then calculated for each region.</p>
</div>
<div id="land-based-inorganic-pollution" class="section level4">
<h4>Land-based inorganic pollution</h4>
<p>These data are from Halpern et al. (2008, 2015), and available from Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB, <a href="https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#view/doi:10.5063/F19021PC,%20rescaled_2013_inorganic_mol">https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#view/doi:10.5063/F19021PC, rescaled_2013_inorganic_mol</a>). Non-point source inorganic pollution was modeled with global 1 km<sup>2</sup> impervious surface area data <a href="http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/dmsp/" class="uri">http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/dmsp/</a> under the assumption that most of this pollution comes from urban runoff. These data will not capture point-sources of pollution or nonpoint sources where paved roads do not exist (e.g., select places in developing countries). Values were aggregated to the watershed and distributed to the pour point (i.e., stream and river mouths) for the watershed with raster statistics (i.e., aggregation by watershed).</p>
</div>
<div id="ocean-pollution-shipping-lanes-ports" class="section level4">
<h4>Ocean pollution (shipping lanes, ports)</h4>
<p>These data are from Halpern et al. (2015), and available from the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB, <a href="https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#view/doi:10.5063/F1DR2SDD" class="uri">https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#view/doi:10.5063/F1DR2SDD</a>, rescaled_2013_one_ocean_pollution_mol). Ocean-based pollution combines commercial shipping traffic data and port data.</p>
<p>Shipping data was obtained from two sources: (1) Over the past 20 years, 10-20% of the vessel fleet has voluntarily participated in collecting meteorological data for the open ocean, which includes location at the time of measurement, as part of the Volunteer Observing System (VOS). (2) In order to improve maritime safety, in 2002 the International Maritime Organization SOLAS agreement required all vessels over 300 gross tonnage (GT) and vessels carrying passengers to equip Automatic Identification System (AIS) transceivers, which use the Global Positioning System (GPS) to precisely locate vessels.</p>
<p>Port data was based on the volume (measured in tonnes) of goods transported through commercial ports as a proxy measure of port traffic. Total cargo volume data by port was collected from regional and national statistical organizations, and from published port rankings.</p>

<p>See description for <strong>Chemical pollution</strong> layer.</p>
<p>The inverse of the pressure data (1 - Coastal chemical pollution) was used to estimate chemical trends for the clean water goal. The proportional yearly change in chemical pressure values were estimated using a linear regression model of the most recent five years of data (i.e., slope divided by value from the earliest year included in the regression model). The slope was then multiplied by five to get the predicted change in 5 years.</p>
<p>The only layer with yearly data was land-based organic pollution (pesticide data). The land-based inorganic pollution (using impermeable surfaces as a proxy) and ocean pollution (shipping and ports) remained the same across years.</p>

The World Bank defines gdp as the gross value of all resident producers in the economy plus product taxes and minus and subsidies not included in the value of the products. The gdp is adjusted by population size to get per capita output and by purchasing power parity (ppp) to account for the difference in exchange rates between countries. Values for ppppcgdp were rescaled to values between zero and one by taking the natural log of the values and dividing by the 99th quantile value across all years/regions (2005 to most recent year).</p>
<p>When a region is missing some years of data, a within region linear model is used to estimate the missing values.</p>

<p><em>Subcategory: nonindigenous species</em></p>
<p>This layer represents the potential for harmful genetic escapement based on whether the species being cultured is native or introduced. Data come from the Mariculture Sustainability Index (MSI, Trujillo 2008). In the MSI analysis native species receive the highest score (10), while foreign and introduced species receive the lowest (1) on the premise of potential impacts to local biodiversity if these species were to escape. Use of native but non-local species were scored intermediately based on the assumption that potentially negative alterations to genetic biodiversity occur from non-local sources as well, but to a lower degree. Genetic ‘pollution’ can arise when larvae, spats or seeds escape from poorly managed hatcheries, making native species vulnerable to outbreeding depressions and/or genetic bottlenecks. The MSI reports data for 359 country-species combinations (with 53 countries represented). Where multiple scores exist for a country the weighted average of all scores (0-10) is used. All country scores were then rescaled from 0 to 1, using the maximum raw score of 10 and minimum of 1. Countries that were not analyzed by Trujillo did not receive a score and this pressure layer falls out of their analyses.</p>

<p>See <strong>Habitat extent of coral</strong> layer for more information.</p>
<p>Coral condition was calculated using current condition data divided by reference condition. We used condition data from percent live coral cover from 12,634 surveys from 1975-2006 (Bruno and Selig 2007, Schutte et al. 2010). When multiple data points were available for the same site and year, we averaged these data, and also averaged the site data to calculate a per country per year average. However, data were missing for several countries and some countries did not have data for the reference or current year time periods or had only 1-2 surveys. Because coral cover can be highly temporally and spatially dynamic, having only a few surveys that may have been motivated by different reasons (i.e., documenting a pristine or an impacted habitat) can bias results. To calculate condition we used fitted values from a linear trend of all data per country, which was more robust to data poor situations and allowed us to take advantage of periods of intense sampling that did not always include both current and reference years. Then, we created a fitted linear model of all these data points from 1975-2010, provided that 2 or more points are in 1980-1995 and 2 or more points are in 2000-2010. We defined the ‘current’ condition (health) as the mean of the predicted values for 2008-2010, and the reference condition as the mean of the predicted values for 1985-1987. Where country data were not available, we used an average from adjacent EEZs weighted by habitat area, or a georegional average weighted by habitat area, based on countries within the same ocean basin (Figure 6.1).</p>

<p>Seagrass condition was calculated on a per-site basis from Waycott et al. (2009), which provides seagrass habitat extent data for several sites around the world over several years. Reference condition was calculated as the mean of the three oldest years between 1975-1985, or the two earliest years if needed. If data meeting these conditions was not available, we fitted a linear model to all data points, and then used the mean of the predicted values for 1979-1981 as the reference condition. For the current condition we used the mean of the three most recent years after 2000 or the two most recent years. If condition data satisfying these constraints were still not available, we fitted a linear model to all data points, provided that there were at least three data points and then used the mean of the predicted values for 2008-2010 as the current condition and the mean of the predicted values for 1979-1981 as the reference condition. Otherwise, we used neighboring (adjacent) regional averages, weighted by habitat area, or averages weighted by habitat area using seagrass geographical regions as defined by Hemminga and Duarte (2000). We did not project beyond a 15-year timeframe.</p>

<p>Soft bottom subtidal habitat condition was estimated using intensity of trawl fishing relative to soft bottom subtidal habitat area. Global catch data (Watson 2017) is provided at 0.5 degree raster scale in units of tonnes/km2 for each species and fishing gear type. We identify catch from trawling gear, defined as dredges, hand dredges, bottom trawls, and shrimp trawls (mid-water trawls were excluded). We sum the trawled catch data for each OHI region for each year, and convert to catch density by dividing the annual catch by the area of trawlable (soft-bottom) habitat. ‘Trawlable habitat’ within a region was defined as shallow subtidal (0-60m) and outer shelf (60-200m) soft bottom habitat. Because the density data were extremely skewed, we <span class="math inline">\(ln(X+1)\)</span> transformed them and then rescaled to the 95th quantile value from all year-country possibilities. Condition was then calculated as one minus the rescaled catch density in the most recent year and further rescaled to the median condition value across all years, and any value greater than the median was set = 1.0.</p>

<p>General trends in salt marsh area were determined from 1994-2007 using data from multiple sources (Bridgham et al. 2006, Dahl 2011, Ministry for the Environment 2007, JNCC 2004, EEA 2008). For trend estimates, we extracted categorical condition data (‘increasing”, “stable”, “declining” score as 0.5, 0.0, and -0.5, respectively) from these sources on a per country basis when both a current and reference data year were available.</p>

<p>Trend in seagrass condition was determined using two data sources (Waycott et al. 2009, Short et al. 2010). Short et al. (2010) measured percent cover on a per sample, per site, per year basis, whereas Waycott et al. (2009) measured habitat area on a per site, per year basis. We used data from Short if there were at least 3 data points between 2001-2010. If this condition was not met, we calculated trends from Waycott for the most recent 10 years after 1990 or else we used the mean of the trend in the adjacent regions or the regions within the corresponding seagrass geographical regions using the same methods described above for the in status.</p>

<p>Saltmarsh data are used to calculate the coastal proection and carbon storage goals, and the habitat subgoal.</p>
<p>Salt marsh extent area (km<sup>2</sup>) comes from multiple sources (Bridgham et al. 2006, Dahl 2000, Ministry for the Environment 2007, JNCC 2004, EEA 2008). In the case of Europe, most data were obtained via the European Environment Agency databases housing information pertaining to the European Union’s Habitat Directive.</p>
<p>Severe data gaps exist for several key regions of the world, including the Middle East, South America, and Africa. Extensive salt marshes are believed to exist in the Middle East, bordering the unique salt flat ecosystems known as sabkha, however no numbers concerning extent could be found. Similarly, data on salt marshes in South America were extremely limited, with no estimates on current rates of loss or historical extent from or before the 1970s. The majority of the data included in the model come from North America (United States and Canada), Australia, New Zealand, China, Europe, and the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Reefs at Risk Revisited (Burke et al. 2007) recorded the global presence of destructive artisanal blast and poison (cyanide) fishing based on survey observations and expert opinion. We reclassified the log-scale scoring system for the blast and poison rasters, so 0 = 0, 100 = 1, 1000 = 2. The mean raster score was then determined for each OHI region. The poison and blast values for each region were then summed to get the total.</p>
<p>A notable limitation of using these data as a proxy for high bycatch artisanal fishing is that they only cover coral reef habitats. High bycatch artisanal fishing likely exists in every coastal country on the planet, but we have no way of knowing the type or extent (for every country).</p>

<p>This layer describes the relative pressure of high bycatch commercial fishing practices for each OHI region. The fishery data (Watson 2017) describe catch (tonnes/km<sup>2</sup>) for each species and gear type at the 0.5 degree raster global scale. For each raster cell, we summed catch from high bycatch gear types (e.g., pots, traps, trawl, long-line; Halpern et al. 2008) for the following categories: large scale fishing catch rate (LSF_CR), illegal unreported unregulated catch rate (IUU_CR), and discard catch rate (Discards_CR).</p>
<p>The catch was then divided by the mean net primary productivity (mg C/m<sup>2</sup>/day) derived from monthly output from the Vertically Generalized Production Model (VGPM, <a href="http://www.science.oregonstate.edu/ocean.productivity/" class="uri">http://www.science.oregonstate.edu/ocean.productivity/</a>, 0.5 degree global raster data). Standardizing catch by primary productivity controls for the fact that similar amounts of catch impart different pressures depending on the productivity in the region.</p>
<p>The layer was rescaled from 0 to 1 using the 99.99th quantile of the entire data layer across all years of data.</p>
<p>To summarize at the OHI region scale, the mean value of the raster cells within each OHI region was calculated.</p>

<p>This data layer provides the risk category and the year the species was assessed from the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (<a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/" class="uri">http://www.iucnredlist.org/</a>) for the iconic species in each region. Regionally specific IUCN risk category data for <em>subpopulations</em> are included where available. Trend calculations are based on the change in each species’ IUCN risk category over time, based upon past and current IUCN assessments.</p>
<p>OHI defines iconic species as those relevant to local cultural identity through the species’ relationship to traditional activities such as fishing, hunting, commerce or involvement in local ethnic or religious practices; and species with locally-recognized aesthetic value (e.g., touristic attractions/common artistic subjects such as whales). Habitat forming species are excluded in this definition of iconic species. The OHI global iconic species list combines three species lists from WWF Global: global priorities, regional and local priorities, and flagship species. The criteria for including species on the WWF lists are consistent with the OHI’s definition of iconic species.</p>
<p>Once the species lists were obtained, each species was assigned to a region based on native range countries from the IUCN Red List.</p>
<p>Most of the iconic species are not region specific, and the global list is applied across all regions. However, some countries have developed national priority and flagship species lists in conjunction with WWF. These region-specific iconic species lists supplement the global list for those specific countries only. In addition, as countries and regions conduct OHI regional assessments (<a href="http://ohi-science.org/projects/" class="uri">http://ohi-science.org/projects/</a>), we will use the iconic species list developed by those countries/regions to supplement our global model. For example, iconic species identified for the Baltic Health Index regional assessment have been included for all countries bordering the Baltic Sea.</p>

<p>This layer includes yearly data for jobs in commercial fishing, mariculture, marine mammal watching, marine renewable energy, and, tourism. The data sources and methods for each sector are described below.</p>
</div>
<div id="commercial-fishing" class="section level4">
<h4>Commercial fishing</h4>
<p>Data are from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Fisheries and Aquaculture Department which provides a Global Number of Fishers dataset ( <a href="http://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/global-fishers/en.">http://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/global-fishers/en</a>). The data include yearly total numbers of employees in commercial fishing, subsistence fishing, and aquaculture (land- and ocean-based combined) in more than 160 countries. The dataset includes the following occupational categories: aquatic-life cultivation, inland waters fishing, marine coastal waters fishing, marine deepsea waters fishing, subsistence and unspecified. We omitted jobs with an unspecified category to avoid overestimating employment for marine fishing or aquaculture. We omitted jobs in the subsistence category since subsistence opportunities are captured by the artisanal fishing opportunity goal and in the aquatic-life cultivation category since that represents a distinct sector (see mariculture below). For commercial fishing, we eliminated inland waters fishing and summed marine coastal waters and marine deep-sea waters fishing for each country in each year. Data are reported separately for men and women, but we summed these numbers. Employment is disaggregated into full-time, parttime, occasional, and unspecified statuses. These categories are defined as full time workers having &gt; 90% of their time or livelihood from fishing/aquaculture, part time workers are between 30-90% time (or 30-90% of their livelihood) and occasional workers are &lt; 30% time. Unspecified status workers could fall anywhere from 0-100% time. Taking the midpoints of those ranges, we assume that 1 part time worker = 0.6 full time workers, 1 occasional worker = 0.15 full time workers, and 1 unspecified worker = 0.5 full time workers, which we used as a weighting scheme for determining total numbers of jobs. The dataset has significant gaps, but it provides the most comprehensive source of global data on commercial fishing and aquaculture employment.</p>
</div>
<div id="mariculture" class="section level4">
<h4>Mariculture</h4>
<p>We used the FAO Global Number of Fishers dataset (see commercial fishing above for full description) to estimate jobs for mariculture. For this sector, we used data in the aquatic-life cultivation category. Again, employment is disaggregated into full-time, part-time, occasional, and unspecified statuses and we implement a weighting scheme where full time = 1 job, part-time = 0.6, occasional = 0.15, and unspecified = 0.5. Aquatic-life cultivation includes marine, brackish and freshwater aquaculture. In order to estimate the proportion of total aquaculture jobs that can be attributed to marine and brackish aquaculture, we used country-specific proportions of marine and brackish aquaculture revenues (compared to total revenues) calculated from FAO aquaculture production data, assuming that numbers of jobs approximately scale with production in terms of revenue. For country-years with no data for the proportion of marine/brackish production because of gaps in the FAO production data, we used the proportion from the most recent year for which data were available. For countries without proportion estimates from any years, we used the average proportion from the country’s geographic region (e.g., Caribbean, Polynesia, Eastern Asia), with the exception of American Samoa, for which we used the proportion value from Guam.</p>

<p>The International Fund for Animal Welfare’s (IFAW) Whale Division provides time series data on whale watching in more than 115 coastal countries (O’Connor et al 2009). This dataset may be an imperfect representation of all marine mammal watching due to its focus on whales, although it does include data for other types of marine mammal watching (e.g., dolphins). However, to our knowledge, it is the most complete dataset pertaining to the global marine mammal watching industry. We obtained regional averages of the number of whale watchers per employee, as well as the number of whale watchers in each country. Using this information, we estimated the number of whale watching jobs in each country by dividing the country’s total number of whale watchers by the average number of whale watchers per employee for that country’s region (e.g., Africa &amp; Middle East, Europe, North America). It is important to note that data are not annual, but there are at least four years of data for each country. When IFAW reported “minimal” numbers of whale watchers, we converted this description to a 0 for lack of additional information. Because some of the whale watching in O’Connor et al. focused on freshwater cetacean viewing, we categorized the target species listed for each country as freshwater or marine. For countries with both marine and freshwater species, we categorized the whale watching in those countries as either 50% or 90% marine, based on the number of marine versus freshwater target species and information provided in the report narrative. For Colombia and Indonesia, more detailed information in the report narrative allowed for a more precise determination of the percentage of marine-based whale watching. We applied these marine proportions to data on the number of whale watchers before converting these estimates into employment estimates.</p>

<div id="marine-renewable-energy" class="section level4">
<h4>Marine renewable energy</h4>
<p>The number of marine renewable energy jobs was determined for the two countries, France and Canada, which produce significant enough amounts of tidal energy to register with the UN Energy Statistics Database <a href="http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=EDATA&amp;f=cmID%3aEO">http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=EDATA&amp;f=cmID%3aEO</a>. For the La Rance plant in France, employment information was obtained from a recent press statement (EDF 2011); we assumed employment stayed constant over the time period for which we had production data for this plant, given relatively consistent or even growing production. For the Annopolis Royal plant in Canada, we received yearly employment information from the plant (Ruth Thorbourne, personal communication, Aug 9 2011).</p>
<p>Marine renewable energy includes five major technologies: tidal barrages, marine currents, waves, ocean thermal converters and salinity gradients. However, we only include data for the largest tidal barrage plants, as these data are available.</p>

<div id="tourism" class="section level4">
<h4>Tourism</h4>
<p>The World Travel &amp; Tourism Council (WTTC) provides data on travel and tourism’s total contribution to employment for 180 countries (<a href="http://www.wttc.org/eng/Tourism_Research/Economic_Data_Search_Tool/" class="uri">http://www.wttc.org/eng/Tourism_Research/Economic_Data_Search_Tool/</a>). Although other global data sources on tourism are available (i.e., United Nations World Tourism Organization, UNTWO), the WTTC database was chosen because it offers yearly time series data that span through the current year, it includes nearly complete coverage of all nations, and it disaggregates direct and total (direct plus indirect) employment impacts of tourism. WTTC provides projected data, however, we do not use these values. We used total employment data to avoid the use of literature derived multiplier effects. The WTTC shares a significant drawback with UNTWO data, in that data on coastal/marine and inland tourism are lumped. Therefore, a country-specific coefficient must be applied to estimate the jobs provided by coastal/marine tourism alone. We adjusted national tourism data by the proportion of a country’s population that lives within a 25 mile inland coastal zone.</p>

<p>See <strong>Mariculture sustainability score</strong> for more information about these data.</p>
<p>Two mariculture practice criteria from the Marine Sustainability Index (Trujillo 2008) contributed to the resilience of mariculture (traceability and code of practice). These are the only 2 social criteria assessed in the MSI that have the potential to positively affect the long term resilience of a mariculture system.</p>
<p>The MSI reports data for 359 country-species combinations (with 60 countries and 86 species represented) for each assessment criterion. Scores for each assessment criterion were aggregated and averaged. All country average scores were then rescaled from 0 to 1 using the maximum possible raw MSI score of 10 and minimum of 1, and then weighted equally to come up with a composite resilience.</p>
<p>Unlike the mariculture sustainability data (<strong>Mariculture sustainability score</strong>), gapfilling was not performed when country specific data were not available for the two resilience measures because these measures are social in nature and reliant on the specific decisions made by each country rather than on the species cultured. As such, it was decided that crosscountry species averages were not appropriate to use in the gapfilling process for resilience.</p>

<p>Three mariculture practice criteria from the Marine Sustainability Index (Trujillo 2008) contributed to the sustainability of mariculture (fishmeal use, waste treatment, and seed and larvae origin criteria). These criteria represent the internal mariculture practices with the potential to affect the long term sustainability of the mariculture system. The MSI reports data for 359 country-species combinations (with 60 countries and 86 species represented) for each assessment criterion. Scores for each assessment criterion were aggregated and averaged based on the proportion of the landings that each assessed species contributed to the overall catch in each country in the current year. All country average scores were then rescaled from 0 to 1 using the maximum possible raw MSI score of 10 and minimum of 1, and then weighted equally to calculate a composite resilience. Because the Index comprises species-specific sustainability values that are combined as a catch-weighted average, when the list of species harvested changes, the sustainability index used in the mariculture sub-goal model also changes due to shifts in the relative composition of harvested species.</p>
<p>Species/country combinations that were not assessed by the MSI were gapfilled using average data from similar taxonomic groupings from other countries (ideally we used the same species, but used more general taxonomic groupings when necessary).</p>

<p>Marine plastic pollution is modeled using data on the global distribution of floating marine plastics at 0.2 degree resolution (Erikson et al. 2014). Specifically, weight of floating plastics (g/km<sup>2</sup>) across four different size classes were aggregated to represent total weight of plastic debris per km<sup>2</sup>. These data were log transformed and rescaled from 0 to 1 using the 99.99th quantile as the reference point.</p>

<p>The total tonnes of six natural product commodities (corals, ornamental fish, shells, fish oil, seaweeds and plants, and sponges) were determined for each region using export data from the FAO Global Commodities database. For each group the sum of the subcategories was calculated. For ornamental fish we excluded the subcategory ‘Fish for culture including ova, fingerlings, etc.’ because it is not specific to ornamental fish, and the subcategory ‘Ornamental freshwater fish’ because it is not from marine systems. Corals and shells are reported together in nine subcategories; we used the subcategories most closely tied to each, leading to the sum of two subcategories for corals and seven subcategories for shells (one subcategory was used for both). We did not use one subcategory – ‘Powder and waste of shells’ – as it likely a byproduct of the other subcategories rather than a primary target (and it comprises a very small amount of the total anyway).</p>
<p>If a country was missing tonnes or dollar values (but had one of the values), the missing data were estimated. FAO provides yearly data for the tonnes and dollar value generated for each natural product, however, countries often provide only one of these variables (and the data provided varies across years). To estimate these missing data, we used country-specific linear models to predict tonnes based on the dollar value of a product (or, vice versa). For the countries that did not have enough data to develop an adequate model, our models included the data for all the countries within a UN geopolitical region. When there wasn’t enough data at the geopolitical region scale, we used all the global data to predict missing values.</p>

<p>These data (Molnar et al. 2008) report the number and type of alien species in each marine ecoregion (Spalding et al. 2007), with species types categorized as invasive and harmful invasive species. For our purposes, total count of all invasive species was used. We intersected the ecoregion data with our reporting units to determine the proportion of each ecoregion that falls within each reporting unit and then assigned this percentage of invasive species from the ecoregion to the reporting unit. The sum of all invasive species within each reporting unit was then rescaled to the maximum global value. Predicting the full potential impact of alien species depends in large part on having high-resolution spatial information on where they exist, how far they have spread and exactly which components of the food web they affect. The data from Molnar et al. approximate these impacts but at ecoregional scales. In addition, the impacts of alien species will vary depending on the goal under consideration. This implies that harmful effects would need to be assessed separately for each goal. Such an endeavor may be possible when applying this framework to a smaller case-study where this type of information can be acquired.</p>

<p>Data were calculated using modeled plumes of land-based nitrogen pollution that provide intensity of pollution at ~1km resolution (Halpern et al. 2008).</p>
<p>Nitrogen pollution was estimated from FAO data on annual country-level fertilizer use (<a href="http://faostat3.fao.org/faostat-gateway/go/to/browse/R/*/E" class="uri">http://faostat3.fao.org/faostat-gateway/go/to/browse/R/*/E</a>), with missing values estimated by regression between fertilizer and pesticides when possible, and when not possible with agricultural GDP as a proxy. Data were summed across all fertilizer compounds and reported in metric tons. Upon inspection the data included multiple 0 values that are most likely data gaps in the time-series, so they were treated as such and replaced with NA. In addition, regions with only 1 data point and regions where the most recent data point was prior to 2005 were excluded. Uninhabited countries were assumed to have no fertilizer use and thus excluded.</p>
<p>These country-level pollution values were then dasymetrically distributed over a country’s landscape using global landcover data from 2009, derived from the MODIS satellite at ~500m resolution. These values were then aggregated by ~140,000 global basins, and diffusive plumes were modeled from each basin’s pourpoint. The final non-zero plumes (about ~76,000) were aggregated into ~1km Mollweide (wgs84) projection rasters to produce a single plume-aggregated pollution raster.</p>
<p>These raw values were then <span class="math inline">\(ln(X+1)\)</span> transformed and normalized to 0-1 by dividing by the 99.99th quantile of raster values across all years. The zonal mean was then calculated for each region.</p>

<h4>Aquarium trade fishing</h4>
<p>To approximate revenue from aquarium fishing we used export data from the FAO Global Commodities database for ‘Ornamental fish’ for all available years.

<h4>Commercial fishing</h4>
<p>Revenue data for commercial fishing were obtained from FAO’s FishStat database, which provides yearly dollar values of commercial fisheries production for marine, brackish and freshwater species starting in 1950 and updated yearly. To isolate production values attributable to marine and brackish aquaculture, data pertaining to freshwater species were omitted. This species classification process was very time consuming as each species had to be queried individually per year. There was little year-to year variation, and thus data were extracted in 5 year increments, providing data for 1997, 2002 and 2007.</p>

<h4>Mariculture</h4>
<p>Data on revenues from marine aquaculture were derived from FAO’s FishStat database, which includes country-level data on total production values for marine, brackish, and freshwater species beginning in 1984 and updated yearly. To isolate production values attributable to marine and brackish aquaculture, data pertaining to freshwater species were omitted. This species classification process was very time consuming as each species had to be queried individually per year.

Here, total expenditures are used as a close proxy for total revenue. We used total expenditure data (direct and indirect expenditures) to avoid using a literature derived multiplier effect. When IFAW reported “minimal” revenue from whale watching, we converted this description to a 0 for lack of additional information. For countries with both marine and freshwater cetacean viewing, we adjusted by the proportion of marine revenue as described for the jobs dataset.</p>

<div id="marine-renewable-energy-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Marine renewable energy</h4>
<p>The United Nations Energy Statistics Database provides production data, in kilowatt-hours (KWh), for tidal and wave electricity. However, only two countries, France and Canada, have high enough levels of production to be reported in this data source. For Canada, production data were replaced with production data (Gross Megawatt hours per year from 1995-2010) provided directly from the Annapolis tidal power plant because the plant provided a longer time series (Ruth Thorbourne, personal communication, Aug 9, 2011). To convert production data into revenue, production values were multiplied by average yearly prices of electricity per KWh specific to Canada and France, provided by the US Energy Information Administration (<a href="http://www.eia.gov/emeu/international/elecprii.html" class="uri">http://www.eia.gov/emeu/international/elecprii.html</a>; updated June 2010) after conversion to 2010 USD. Some of the production data could not be used because there were no available electricity price data to convert production into revenue, truncating our time series.</p>

<h4>Tourism</h4>
<p>WTTC (see <strong>Jobs for each sector and year</strong> layer) reports time series data on the dollar values of visitor exports (spending by foreign visitors) and domestic travel and tourism spending; combining these two data sets creates a proxy for total travel and tourism revenues. WTTC was chosen as the source for tourism revenue data because of the near-complete country coverage, the yearly time series component starting in 1988 and updated yearly, and the inclusion of both foreign and domestic expenditures. This dataset lumps inland and coastal/marine revenues, and so was adjusted by the percent of a country’s population within a 25 mile inland coastal zone. We included no projected data. We used total contribution to GDP data (rather than direct contribution to GDP) to avoid the use of literature derived multiplier effects.</p>

<p>The sea level rise pressure layer is derived from satellite altimetry data (<a href="http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/products/sea-surface-height-products/global/msla-mean-climatology.html" class="uri">http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/products/sea-surface-height-products/global/msla-mean-climatology.html</a>). Monthly mean sea level anomalies from 1993 through 2015 track changes in sea level (mm) compared to a reference period from 1993-2012. Raw monthly data are provided on a 0.25x0.25 degree grid. These data were clipped to within 3 nautical miles of the coast, and monthly data layers were aggregated and averaged across pixels to compute mean sea level anomalies. The 99.99th quantile of raster values from all years was used as the reference point to rescale the layer from 0 to 1. All negative values were set to zero (i.e., no negative pressure), such that only positive sea level rise values mattered. The mean value of the raster cells within each OHI region was calculated.</p>

<p>Sea surface temperature (SST) data were obtained from the Coral Reef Temperature Anomaly Database (CoRTAD) (Casey et al. 2015), which is produced by the NOAA National Center for Environmental Information (NCEI) using 4.6 km (nominally 21 km<sup>2</sup> at the equator) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Pathfinder Version 5.2 SST data (<a href="http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/sog/cortad/" class="uri">http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/sog/cortad/</a>). Weekly SST data are used to compute the standard deviation (SD) of SST’s per pixel across all years. We define an anomaly as exceeding the standard deviation of SSTs from the climatology for that location (i.e., grid cell) and week of the year. The frequency of weekly anomalies was calculated for each year in the dataset. We then quantified the difference between the number of anomalies in the 5 most recent years and the 5 oldest years in the dataset. The 99.99th quantile of raster values from all years was used as the reference point to rescale the layer from 0 to 1, and the mean value of the raster cells within each OHI region was calculated.</p>
<p>Because SST measurements are less reliable where there is persistent ice, we created an ice mask to identify places near the poles that were almost always covered by significant sea ice. The ice mask was generated primarily from the OSI/SAF Global Daily Sea Ice Concentration Reprocessing Data Set (accession.nodc.noaa.gov/0068294), which was regridded and made available in the Pathfinder V5.2 dataset. In Pathfinder, when the OSI/SAF data are unavailable, the sea ice concentrations from the NCDC Daily OI SST data (Reynolds et al. 2007) are included. For each day of the climatological year (1 through 366), we read in the daily sea ice fraction for that day from all of the years and averaged them to create a daily, sea-ice fraction climatology. We then identified grid cells that always contained a sea ice fraction of greater than 0.15 and masked them out of the analysis.</p>

The SPI score is the average of 3 dimensions, and each dimension is the average of 4 components. Each component includes several indicators that are scaled from 0 to 100. When a region was missing 1 or more component, but not all of them, we used the aregImpute function from the Hmisc package to estimate the dimension value based on the available component values. Regions with no dimension/component data were estimated using a linear regression model with UN geopolitical region and WGI data as predictor variables. Uninhabited regions received no score.</p>

<p>The Worldwide Governance Indicator (WGI) is composed of six dimensions of governance: voice and accountability, political stability and absence of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, control of corruption. These 6 aggregate indicators combine data from a variety of survey institutes, think tanks, NGOs, and international organizations to report on the relative governance of 213 economies worldwide. The WGI combines individual indicators through an Unobserved Components Model to produce the 6 dimensions of governance that range in value from approximately -2.5 to 2.5, have a normal distribution, a mean of zero, and a standard deviation of 1. We take an average of the six dimension scores to produce a single governance score for each country. Social pressure is then calculated as one minus this average WGI score.</p>
<p>WGI scores are provided for China/Hong Kong/Macao and Puerto Rico/Virgin Island, which are combine OHI regions. These scores were averaged, weighted by population.</p>

<p>The Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index is produced by the World Economic Forum and measures the factors and policies that make a country an attractive place to invest in the travel and tourism sector (WEF 2015, <a href="http://reports.weforum.org/travel-and-tourism-competitiveness-report-2015" class="uri">http://reports.weforum.org/travel-and-tourism-competitiveness-report-2015</a>). The index analyzes 140 countries and scores each based on three sub-indices: human, cultural, and natural resources; business environment and infrastructure; and regulatory framework. These three sub-indices are in turn composed of 14 “pillars” of Travel &amp; Tourism Competitiveness that are informed by a multitude of individual indicators based on the World Economic Forum’s annual Executive Opinion Survey and data from publically available sources: human, cultural, and natural resources (human resources, affinity for travel and tourism, natural resources, and cultural resources); business environment and infrastructure (air transport infrastructure, ground transport infrastructure, tourism infrastructure, ICT infrastructure, and price competitiveness in the industry); and regulatory framework (policy rules and regulations, environmental sustainability, safety and security, health and hygiene, and prioritization of travel and tourism). Because these indicators are meant to represent the overall quality and future potential of the tourism sector within a country, we assume they are representative of the long term sustainability of the tourism sector within each country. Values range from 1-6.</p>
<p>For countries not assessed, values were estimated using a linear regression model specific to each UN geopolitical region using per-capita GDP as a predictor variable.</p>

<p>The ultraviolet radiation (UV) pressure layer is derived from daily Local Noon Erythemal UV Irradiance (mW/m<sup>2</sup>) data. The Aura/OMI satellite provides data at 1x1 degree resolution from September 2004 through present, spanning 180 degrees latitude and 360 degrees longitude. Raster data are provided in HDF5 format by the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GESDISC, (<a href="http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/data-holdings/OMI/omuvbd_v003.shtml" class="uri">http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/Aura/data-holdings/OMI/omuvbd_v003.shtml</a>). Raw data was downloaded, translated to GeoTIFFs using R and aggregated to weekly means.</p>
<p>This pressure measures the number of times the weekly average of each 1 degree cell exceeds the climatological mean + 1 standard deviation, defined as an anomalous value. The frequency of weekly anomalies was calculated for each year in the dataset. We then quantified the difference between the number of anomalies in the 5 most recent years and the 5 oldest years in the dataset. The 99.99th quantile of raster values from all years was used as the reference point to rescale the layer from 0 to 1, and the mean value of the raster cells within each OHI region was calculated.</p>

<p>We used the Occupational Wages around the World (OWW) database produced by Remco H. Oostendorp and Richard B. Freeman in 2005 (<a href="http://www.nber.org/oww/" class="uri">http://www.nber.org/oww/</a>). These data were drawn from the International Labour Organization and subjected to a standardization process (for more information, see <a href="http://www.nber.org/oww/Technical%20_document_1983-2003_standardizationv3.pdf">http://www.nber.org/oww/Technical _document_1983-2003_standardizationv3.pdf</a>). The database provides several different calibrations, and we use the “x3wl calibration”, described as a “country-specific and uniform calibration with lexicographic weighting,” and recommended as being the preferred calibration in most cases. Although significant gaps exist in this database, it contains country-specific information on average wages in many industries for more than 150 countries from 1983-2003. Data represent average monthly wages of a male worker. Wage data were divided by the inflation conversion factor for 2010 so that wage data across years would be comparable (<a href="http://oregonstate.edu/cla/polisci/sahr/sahr" class="uri">http://oregonstate.edu/cla/polisci/sahr/sahr</a>), and then multiplied by the purchasing power parity-adjusted per capita gdp (ppppcgdp, WorldBank). The adjusted wage data were then multiplied by 12 to get annual wages. We used the industry and occupation classifications reported in the OWW to estimate wages for marine-related sectors.</p>
