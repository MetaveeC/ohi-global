  2017 marks the sixth year of annual global Ocean Health Index (OHI) assessments, with scores representing ocean health for 220 coastal nations and territories. After the fifth consecutive assessment in 2016, we also explored trends and trajectories in ocean health and assessed how well the Ocean Health Index has performed as an indicator.

  **The average 2017 Index score was 70 out of 100**.  
Average Index scores have not dramatically changed over six years, which could be expected at a global scale. However, some individual goals and regions have had significant changes.

  The OHI framework has not changed since its inception in 2012 ([*Halpern et al. 2012*](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v488/n7413/full/nature11397.html)). We continue to assess ocean health based on the sustainable delivery of 10 goals that are of importance to humans.  We score each goal on a scale of 0-100 based on current status, trend, and external pressures and resilience measures.  Scores are calculated for each coastal nation before being combined together. However, the OHI benefits from constant evaluation and improvement aimed at incorporating new knowledge, data and understanding, and underlying methods for some goals have been upgraded.
