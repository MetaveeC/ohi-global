Here is a brief description of the ohicore functions:

**dataprep functions**

* gapfill_georegions: gapfilling with georegion means
* name_to_rgn: converts country names to rgn_id and deals with sovereign countrys

**core organizing/checking data layers functions**

* CheckLayers: runs checks on data 
* Conf: 
* Layers:
* SelectLayersData.R

**core calculation functions**

CalculateAll:  Primary function used to calculate all the scores (calls a variety of functions)

* CalculatePressuresAll: Calculate pressure
    + CalculatesPressuresScore
    + CalculatePressuresMatrix
* CalculateResilienceAll: Calculate resilience
    + CalculateResilienceScore
    + CalculateResilienceMatrix
* CalculateGoalIndex: Calculate scores
* CalculateSubgoal: Computes a single subgoal
    + CalculateStatusComponent
    + CalculatePressuresComponent
    + CalculateResilienceComponent
* ScoreScaling: functions for scaling data (score.rescale, score.max, score.clamp)
    
**after scores are calculated**
* Git related functions
    + read_git_csv: read a csv from git file
    + trace_git_csv: trace value from csv file through history of local Git repository
* Checking/comparing data
    + compare_scores_df: compare 2 scores.csv files and calculate difference
* Reporting
    + PlotFlower: make the flower plots
    + aster: make the flower plots (I think this is the same thing as PlotFlower)
    + ReportScores: part of report generation, but I'm not sure this was ever completed
    + ReportScoresComparison: part of report generation, but I'm not sure this was ever completed (look for report.Rmd in files)

**apps**
* shp_to_geojson: save a shape file as GeoJson
* launch_app
* launch_cmp
* write_shortcuts

**unknown how used**
* get_scenarios.R: downloads entire repository, not sure why
* zzz: appears to control how packages are downloaded (but doesn't look like anything)
* data: references data from 2012 analysis, but I am not sure what is happening
* PlotChloroPlethMap.R: This doesn't look like anything related to what we are doing
